"JUDGMENT  R.C. OWUSU, JA:  This is an appeal against the Judgment of His Lordship Nana Barfour Adjei (Chairman) sitting with Messrs Eric Wood and George Amissah, Miss Cobbah-Yalley and Florence Dadzie as panel members delivered on 15/11/2001 at the Regional Tribunal Cape Coast.  The appellant herein had been charge on two counts of careless driving contrary to Sec. 18(1) of R.T.O. 55/52 as amended by section 4 of Act 553 of 1998 and Negligently causing Harm contrary to section 72 of the Criminal Code of 1960 (Act 29).  He was arraigned before the Community Tribunal, Elmina in the Central Region, tried and found guilty on both Counts. He was convicted on both counts and sentenced to a fine of �200,000.00 or 4 months I.H.L in default. He paid the fine.  Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence however, he appealed to the Regional Tribunal, Cape Coast on the grounds that:  i. “The Judgment is not supported by the evidence on record.  ii. The trial Court Erred in holding that the point of impact was in the lane of traffic of PW1.  iii. The trial court failed to appreciate the defence of the Accused.  iv. The trial court failed to adequately evaluate the evidence on record.  v. The trial court failed to consider the fact that the 3rd party by driving into the lane of the Accused at a short distance placed the Accused in extreme peril and that which the Accused did or omitted to do in the agony of the moment cannot fairly be treated as negligence.  vi. The reasons adduced by the trial court for the rejection of the evidence of Dw1 are untenable in law.  vii. The trial court erred palpably in holding that the duty of avoidance of collision was on the Accused and not the third party vehicle which was doing the overtaking.  viii. The court failed to appreciate the burden of proof placed on the prosecution and thereby erroneously shifted that burden onto the accused to prove his innocence.  ix. The trial court failed to consider the issues raised in the address submitted by counsel on behalf of the accused.  x. Additional grounds of appeal will be filed upon receipt of the record of appeal.  His appeal was disallowed by the Regional Tribunal. It is against the decision of the Regional Tribunal that he has appealed to this court on the grounds that:—  1\. “ The tribunal failed to critically evaluate the evidence.  2\. The tribunal Erred in dismissing the Appeal.  3\. The tribunal Erred in holding that the appellant was negligent.  4\. The finding by the tribunal that the Appellant was confused and panicky and this caused the accident is not borne out by the evidence on record.  5\. The Judgment was erroneous and not the result of proper resolution of the facts in issue since the tribunal failed to consider the several facts which were in favour of the appellant and which were sufficient to exonerate him from the charge.  The facts of the case as alleged by the prosecution are that on 18/1/2001 at about 7.15 p.m, the appellant herein, Joseph Donkor of Union Transport Africa Ltd, Takoradi drove Scania Cement Articulated Tanker No. GT 7086 A loaded with cement from Takoradi to Acheampong near Tarkwa. Between Bronyibima and Yesumkwa along Cape Coast-Takoradi Road, accused drove into the lane of an on coming Mercedes Benz Car No. GW 2686 Q then being driven by one Michael Hackenberg, General Manager Construction pioneers (CP) and hit the Benz car which caught fire and burnt completely.  One Doctor Spark who was with the driver on the Mercedes Benz sustained injuries. According to PW1, who was driving the Mercedes Benz Car, the Appellant tried to avoid hitting him in his lane so he swerved into his (Appellant’s) lane again but the Trailer of his truck fell down and hit his car in his lane.  The fact that the Articulated Truck was driven into the lane of the Mercedes Benz was denied by the defence which contended that it was rather the driver of the Mercedes Benz who drove into the lane of the Truck.  Counsel for the Appellant at the hearing of the appeal, abandoned ground 2 of the appeal.  Grounds 1, 3 and 5 were argued together. Counsel submitted that the findings made by the court cannot be supported by the evidence.  The Appellate tribunal dismissed the Appellant’s appeal because, as the Judgment of the Tribunal reads “We cannot agree more with the lower court in its observation above. We therefore hold that the trial court was right in its Judgment and we have no just cause to disturb it, the findings made by the trial court were supported by the evidence.”  The trial court had found the appellant “negligent and careless”. That “he refused to keep a proper look out and in his own words, he never saw PW1’s Benz Car”.  Counsel had seriously argued before this court that the appellant was not careless and that what he did when confronted with imminent danger was reasonably necessary in the circumstances and cannot amount to negligence.  He referred the Court to the case of ASIBI (HAUSA) VRS FRANCIS EFFAH, Court of Appeal, Civil Appeal NO. 33/69 of 26th February 1970 (unreported) referred to by P. K. Twumasi in his Criminal Law in Ghana p. 606.  Counsel submitted that the appellant was faced with imminent danger of running into the Toyota Land Cruiser which had overtaken another vehicle and had found itself in his lane. He applied his brakes to avoid fatalities.  According to the appellant himself this was when he got out of a curve. The legal position is that where a person is confronted with an emergency he cannot be expected to conduct himself in a way a reasonable and prudent man would do in ordinary Circumstances. His blameworthiness must be Judged by the peculiar and unusual situation.  See the case of LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BOARD VRS. UPSON \[1949\] A.C. 155, referred to in Twumasi’s Criminal Law in Ghana p.606.  Attached to this principle is a rider that where, however, the emergency was created by an earlier act of negligence by the person concerned he cannot escape liability for the consequences of the situation he created by his own negligent act. So in this case, was the situation in which the appellant found himself brought about by an earlier act of carelessness on his part?  According to the appellant himself, he had finished negotiating a curve on the road. The accident had happened late in the evening, about 7.15 p.m. and visibility was poor. PW2 told the trial court that he could not take measurements that night because of visibility.  From the sketch of the scene of accident, Exh “A”, the distance between where the appellant sighted vehicle No 2686Q to the point of impact measured 205”. The appellant did sign the sketch by way of approval in the presence of an independent witness. At the trial, even though he did not object to the tendering of the sketch in evidence, he denied that the point of impact as indicated on the sketch was the actual point of impact. He told the Court the point of impact was in his lane of traffic but not in the lane of traffic of PW1 as indicated on the sketch.  His denial per se, did not render the sketch inadmissible as contended by Counsel in the trial court. The appellant did not raise any objection to the tendering of the statement. Even if he had raised an objection, its admissibility like a confession statement would have been decided on evidence only where the appellant had denied signing the sketch or that he had signed under duress. Where the objection is raised on the ground of inaccuracy, it must first be admitted before it can be evaluated. The weight to be attached to it is a question of fact. See the case of ASARE alias FANTI VRS THE STATE \[1964\] GLR 70. The appellant did not object to the distance between where he sighted PW1’s vehicle and where the two vehicles collided whether in his lane of traffic or that of the other vehicle.  As to the lane of traffic in which the vehicle collided, the appellant in his own statement told the police it was in PW1’s lane. This was the statement taken a day after the accident. 10 days later, on 29/3/2001 when given the opportunity to make another statement, he relied on his former statement made on 19/3/2001. Counsel urged it upon this court not to attach any weight to the statement because the appellant was remanded in custody and had been denied medical care on the day of the accident and that the statement was taken the next morning.  I find this submission strange because one would have thought that having slept over night, the Appellant rather would have reflected on the events leading to the accident and would remember correctly how and where the accident happened. If what he had told the police in that statement was not correct, he had another opportunity on which he could have changed same.  Like the sketch, the statement was tendered without objection and the contents were not denied. The weight to be attached to it was a question of fact for the trial court. I therefore see no reason why this court should be called upon not to attach any weight to it, a duty reserved for the trial court which had evaluated the statement.  Under Cross-examination, the Appellant was asked the following questions:  Q. “What time after the accident did you make your statement to the police”.  A. “After the Police went to take measurement the next day.""  Q. “so the statement you gave the police and what you are saying now, which one is correct?""  A. “what I am saying now is correct.”  Q. “so what ever you told the police is not correct, it is a lie, I mean your statement?”  A. “I spoke the truth to the police.”  He did not at the trial say that he pointed at a different point of impact which the investigating officer had ignored in the sketch.  The Appellant’s vehicle was a Scania Cement Bulk Tanker which at the time of the accident was loaded with cement. With the size of the vehicle and the load, the Appellant was under a duty to exercise a greater degree of care and attention a prudent and reasonable driver would do especially while negotiating a curve. If he had driven his vehicle with due care and attention required of him, he could have avoided the accident from the distance of 205 feet from where he first sighted the Mercedes Benz Car.  At a speed of 97 k.m.p.h., under the High way Code, a driver should be able to brake from a distance of 180"", from where he first sights an on coming vehicle ….  Even driving at that speed would not be reasonable under the circumstances having regard to the size of the vehicle with the load, that portion of the road where the accident happened and the time of the day. I am very mindful of the fact that speed per se is not evidence of carelessness or negligence but from the appellant’s own evidence, when he applied his brake, he lost control of it and his vehicle started swerving from one lane to the other.  According to the report of the officer in charge of Vehicle Examination and Licensing Department who tested the Appellant’s vehicle after the accident, the brakes, steering and the Electrical Systems were in good working order prior to the accident.  The position in which the appellant found himself was not the result of a Mechanical fault. The evidence does not indicate that the road was slippery at the time.  Counsel for the Appellant urged it upon this court that the point of impact is not a determining factor in deciding the issue of carelessness.  Rather, the position of the law is that the point of impact alone, was not a proper yardstick for resolving issues of road traffic negligence, see HAUSA VS. THE REPUBLIC \[1981\] GLR 840 Twumasi J. (as he then was) in his book Criminal Law in Ghana p. 615 on police sketch of scene of accident, mentions the point of impact as one of the important positions for determining liability for negligent driving.  The trial court held that, it was a crucial factor in the determination of the case before it and found that the point of impact was in the lane of traffic of PW1.  The Appellant therefore is to be blamed for driving into the lane of traffic of PW1 as there is no clear evidence that PW1 who was in his lane, had ample means and opportunity to prevent the accident.  The case of OWUSU VRS. COMMISSIONER OF POLICE \[1963\] 1 GLR p.113 is rather not in favour of the Appellant.  Under Cross-examination, he told the court that he did not even see PW1’s Car ahead of him. In his statement he said he saw a vehicle overtaking PW1’s Car ahead of him. Where he cannot even be sure whether he saw PW1’s Car or not, one can safely say that the Appellant did not drive his vehicle with due care and attention.  The Appellate Tribunal evaluated the evidence on record and came to the conclusion that the findings made by the trial Tribunal are supported by the evidence. This court cannot therefore disturb that finding.  Indeed in this appeal the Chief State Attorney submitted that the Judgment of the Regional Tribunal is supported by the record and called upon the Court to dismiss the appeal.  I will not agree with counsel for the Appellant that the Judgment of the Regional Tribunal is erroneous as same is not based on proper evaluation and resolution of the facts in issues.  The finding that the Appellant became confused and panicky, and that this caused the accident, I must admit is not borne out by the evidence.  In this appeal, counsel for the Appellant said nothing about the second count of Negligently causing Harm, which flows directly from the first count. Its fate depends upon the success or failure of the conviction against the first count as a result of which the person named in the charge sheet in the second count sustained the injury.  Having found that the Appellant drove his vehicle without due care and attention, he must be held liable for Negligently causing Harm to the person named in the second count.  On the totality of the evidence, the appeal against conviction fails and same is hereby dismissed.  R. C. OWUSU (MS)  JUSTICE OF APPEAL  WOOD, JA:  I agree.  G. T. WOOD (MRS.)

"JUDGMENT  H. ABBAN (MRS.)  This is a unanimous decision of the Court.  The appeal before the Court arises out of the judgment of his Lordship Apaloo R. K. sitting at the High Court, Accra and delivered on the 10th day of May 2002. The judgment went in favour of the Plaintiff/Respondent (hereinafter referred to simply as the Respondent). The defendant/Appellant who will also be referred to henceforth in this judgment as simply the Appellant, being dissatisfied with the judgment has appealed to this Court against the said judgment.  The appellant stated five grounds of appeal filed pursuant to leave granted for the appeal to be lodged out of time. Counsel for the Appellant has decided in his wisdom to argue together the 1st and 5th grounds of appeal.  These are:—  “a - The ruling is totally at variance with the totality of evidence adduced at the trial;"" and  “e - The judge made findings of fact that were contradictory and not supported by any evidence on record.”  According to Counsel for the Appellant, the fact that the judge found that the defendant “assaulted and battered the plaintiff at the Fusion Night Club that evening” contradicts his other finding that “at about 1.00 a.m. on 22/5/98 there was a scuffle between the parties at the Fusion Night Club.” Counsel argues that this “scuffle” was amply corroborated by PW1 who was present at the club. His line of argument is that if the trial judge is certain that there was a scuffle between the appellant and the Respondent, then the party who was worse off cannot succeed in an action against the other party simply because he was worse off in the scuffle.  His second ground of appeal is that the learned trial judge erred in granting special damages that had not specifically been endorsed on the writ of summons and had not been proved by the Respondent. Counsel’s argument is that in the law of tort, there is a distinction between general and special damages and that one of the distinctions is in the area of pleadings. He supported this submission with the Susque Lava case \[1926\] A.C. 665 where Lord Dunedin stated at page 661 as follows: “If there be any special damage which is attributable to the wrongful act that special damage must be averred it must be averred that such damage has been suffered but the quantification is a jury question.”  Though Counsel argued at length about the award of damages, both general and special, he finally conceded that if the court is inclined to affirm the judgment of the court below and to uphold the damages awarded, the Court must award only nominal damages in the absence of proof of consequential damages suffered by the Respondent.  The appellant therefore prays this Court to set aside the award made at the Court below and in its stead make a nominal award in favour of the Respondent.  The facts of this case are that on the night of 22nd May 1998 at about 1.00 a.m., the Appellant and the Respondent who were then at the Fusion Night Club, Osu were involved in a scuffle. How did the scuffle start? According to the Respondent, he was seated at a table in the night club with some friends since that date happened to be his 24th birthday and they were celebrating same, when without any provocation from Respondent the Appellant approached their table and asked him to choose a leg to be broken whilst insulting him and his family. Respondent had then returned from France where he had just had a knee surgery from which he was still recovering and he was therefore using crutches. The Appellant then slapped the Respondent and he was about to “punch” the operated knee when the Respondent held his (Appellant’s) wrist.  From the foregoing account which was amply supported by the PW1 (Ali Kwame Maoux) whose evidence-in-chief was to the effect that he saw the Appellant attack the Respondent who was then seated on a bench without any provocation from the latter. This piece of evidence was not discredited under cross-examination nor was any other evidence led through another defence witness to contradict same.  Thus it stands on the records that a battery or “an unwanted physical contact of his person which constitutes the tort of battery” took place on the Respondent on the night of the 22/5/98.  In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm. Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.”  Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct.  The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum.  Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.”  The loss for which the Plaintiff claims compensation must be caused by and must not be too remote a consequence of the defendants tort. Thus in the case before us, the Appellant must reasonably have foreseen that his conduct would aggravate the Respondent’s injury since he knew or should have known that the Respondent was not physically sound considering that he was using crutches.  In our opinion we think the learned trial judge was right in coming to the conclusion he did in finding that it was the Appellant who “left his seat, advanced on the Plaintiff, slapped him” and when the Respondent tried to escape, “pursued him, punching his feet and leg.” Again the fact that the Respondent was using crutches and had had an operation on his knee in France was also not disputed.  The cases of Rookes vrs. Barnavd {1964} A.C. 1129, 1221 – 1233 and Broome vrs. Cassel & Co. Ltd. {1972} A. C. 102 both support the legal principles that the time, place and manner of the trespass and the conduct of the Defendant may be taken into account and the Court may award aggravated damages on these grounds.  This Court therefore does not intend to interfere with the findings of fact by the learned trial judge at the Court below. In view of the principle stated in the two cases just cited supra, we affirm that though it was not the physical assault by the Appellant which caused Defendant’s original injury to his knee; after the trespass to his person, the doctors recommended that he goes back to France for some laboratory tests to be done to assess any fresh damages which may have been done to the knee due to Appellant’s conduct.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/95/2004', 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ON THE TH DAY OF APRIL  BEFORE', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL SITTING AT ACCRA'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': None, 'year': None, 'month': None, 'day': None}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['NAZIRE ABED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CHARLES LABA']}, 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1993 - 2014\\2000\\COURT OF APPEAL\\NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA', 'short': 'NAZIRE ABED vs CHARLES LABA'}}"
"J U D G M E N T  ATUGUBA, JSC:  The sole issue arising in this appeal is who owns the allodial title to Obgojo lands in Accra? Is it the Labadi Stool or the Anahor and Dzirase families of Obgojo village?  In approaching this question one must bear in mind the intricacies of customary land tenure in Ghana. The need for caution in these matters is forcefully stated in holding 2 of the headnote to Bimpong v. Bawuah (1991)2 GLR 20 C.A, as follows:  �(2) In this country, land might for generations be in the occupation of persons who were not owners but who might have rights of occupation as licensees or customary tenants or under other conditions known to customary law, the reversion nevertheless being in the owner. And the owners were willing to allow such occupation so long as the occupier did not make any adverse claims to the land. Hence, the mere occupation of land for long periods was not conclusive evidence of ownership; and it was therefore essential that the specific nature and origin of the tenure of occupiers of land should be determined in all cases. In the instant case, the trial judge should consequently have considered the evidence of occupation with caution and should also have made proper findings of fact as to the nature of the plaintiff�s interest in the Asakraka and Ntabaanu portions of the Besease lands, especially in view of the defendant�s claim that the land was given to his ancestors, which claim the plaintiff contested. However, apart from stating that the plaintiff had exercised acts of ownership over the land, the learned trial judge did not make any findings on the nature and origin of the plaintiff�s possession even though he made positive findings of fact, supported by the evidence on record, as to the settlement of the defendant�s family on the land. Furthermore, there was no certainty about the plaintiff�s title to the land or as to the identity of the portions of the land he claimed. Thus the most that could be said of the nature of the plaintiff�s interest in the Asakraka and Ntabaanu lands was that he was entitled to stay on those portions with the leave and licence of the defendant�s family, and that they (the plaintiff and his family) were entitled to live there as long as they recognised the title of the defendant.�  The appellant claims allodial title to the land by reason of settlement whilst the respondent claims the same by conquest. It is trite law that both modes are legitimate customary means of acquiring such allodial title.  It is notorious that the La stool has acquired certain lands by conquest. See Owusu v. Manche of Labadi (1933) I WACA 278. The burden of the appellant�s case is that though the La Stool owns certain lands by conquest they do not include Obgojo lands.  It is to be noted that the respondent�s claim to the land rests largely on traditional evidence as to the said conquest which dates as far back as 1690. Reliance is also placed on, principally, Owusu v. Manche of Labadi, supra.  Certain facts in the case are beyond dispute. One of them is that the first settlers of Obgojo lands are the Anahor and Dzirase families. Accordingly the only question is whether the allodial title was thereby acquired by them. How and in what capacity the land in dispute was acquired is of course a question of fact in the light of the customary law.  There is no doubt that one of the ways of establishing an allodial title of a stool is occupation and user of the land in question by its subjects after its acquisition by the stool. However occupation and user of land by stool subjects is not necessarily proof of the stool�s title to the land in question.  This legal position has been clearly conveyed by the celebrated and much vaunted case of Owusu v. Manche of Labadi; supra. The facts of the case as summarised in the headnote are as follows:  �The appellants, who are subjects of the Labadi Stool, proved that they and their ancestors had been in possession of the land acquired by Government for at least four generations, and that their ancestor who first took possession of the land found it unoccupied. On these grounds they contended that the land in question had become their private property. They also sought to prove certain acts of ownership on the part of their ancestors and themselves, but failed.  The respondent, on the other hand, proved that the Labadi people had originally acquired a large area of land, including the land in question, by conquest, and that many subjects of the Labadi Stool had settled on the area so acquired. On these grounds he contended that the appellants were merely enjoying the use of Stool land in accordance with native custom, and that their long and uninterrupted user had not ousted the original title of the Stool�.  On these facts Kingdon C.J. Nigeria (Michelin and Webber J.J concurring) at 280-281 held that �the Nkwantanang people have cultivated patches at their will over an area embracing the plots acquired, though no definite limits were set to such area. I think, therefore, that they must be said to be constructively in occupation of the whole area upon which native custom recognises they are entitled to farm, and over which they have been farming for four generations.�  He then immediately continued as follows:  �The second question, then needs to be answered, and the answer of the Court below is clear, viz :- that if there is occupation it is not adverse to the Labadi Stool but is the occupation by Labadi people of Labadi Stool land.  With this finding I am in entire agreement, and I may say at once that I concur with all the findings of fact of the Court below upon the point. The most fundamental is the acceptance of the respondent�s story of the acquisition of the lands in question by conquest so that they became Labadi Stool lands. It was clearly proved that Labadi lands extend well beyond Nkwantanang. For instance Frafraha is further north than Nkwantanang, and the first claimant�s own evidence is �Frafraha is a Labadi village ....Nkwantanang is in the middle of all these Labadi villages�  The overwhelming weight of evidence supports the finding of the Court below �that at the time that Kotei Amli settled at Nkwantanang the land in the neighbourhood which the claimants described as waste land at that time was the property of the Stool of Labadi.�  It seems to me that this finding decides the whole case, it means that from the outset the occupation by Kotei Amli was not adverse to the Labadi Stool and there is nothing to suggest that its nature has changed since. It is this fact which distinguishes the present case from that of Manche Anege Akue v. Manche Kojo Ababio IV, P.C. 1874-1928, 71.�  What should be noted clearly about the ratio decidendi of that case is that the appellants failed in their bid to prove certain acts of ownership such as the collection of tolls and a grant of some of the land to the Basel Mission. They however proved acts of possession which were held not to be adverse to the title of the Labadi Stool. It is also of crucial importance that the appellants were undisputable subjects of the Labadi Stool.  The ratio decidendi in Owusu v. Manche of Labadi is to the same effect as the thrust of the powerful reasoning of Taylor JSC in Nartey v. Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd (1987-88)2 GLR 314 SIC particularly at 352 as follows:  �There is no doubt at all that in Owusu v Manche of Labadi (supra) there were firm pronouncements made that Frafraha lands are La stool lands. In Hammond v. Odoi \[1982-83\] GLR 1215, SC we dealt, with approval, quite exhaustively with the holding in the Court of Appeal that Osu rural lands properly belonged to the Osu stool. La and Osu are contiguous and would seem to have not too divergent customary practices; it is not therefore easy, nor am I prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case (supra) that La rural lands belong to the La stool. Both cases, however, did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land and until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own a rural land, I confess quite frankly that I am not prepared, nor am I in a position to make a judicial pronouncement on the matter. That problem in my view does not arise in this appeal.�  It is plain from the facts of this case that the appellant like his counterpart in the Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd case supra has been able to do what his other counterpart in the Owusu v. Manche case was unable to do.  The evidence clearly shows that when opportunity to exercise acts of ownership arose, particularly as from the days of La Mantse Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya II the appellant and his ancestors have made grants of the disputed land to strangers. Even some of the said grants were instigated by him. He directed the 2nd co-defendant respondent/appellant who is the owner of the 1st and 3rd co-defendants/respondents/ appellants to the appellant�s predecessor as the owner of Obgojo lands from whom he obtained leases in 1979 and 1989 respectively which were registered under the Laws of Ghana, see exhibits 1A, 2A and 3A. He and his said companies have been in active occupation and developments of the land granted without any hindrance. The respondent is not only clearly estopped by the assertions and conduct of his predecessor, Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya II but by all the other grants such as Exhibits II, IIA � IIF. In any event they are active acts of ownership enjoyed by the appellant and his predecessors. The attempts b y the respondent and his elders to fault the appellant�s title after Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya II�s reign are clearly belated after thoughts.  It is a worn-out principle that where in a land suit the evidence as to title to land is traditional and conflicting, the surest guide is to test such evidence in the light of recent acts to see which is preferable. See Adjeibi-Kojo v Bonsie (1957) 3 WALR 257, and In re Adjancote Acquisition; Klu v Agyemang II (1983) GLR 852 C.A.  The appellant�s case has been clearly supported by documentary evidence, open and physical acts of ownership with regard to the land and some independent witnesses such as the 2nd respondent and DW2 the chief of Ashalley Botwe who shares a boundary with Obgojo village. All these in law strengthen the appellant�s case against that of the respondent.  It must be remembered that even where lands are clearly stool lands a different title may nonetheless be carved out of them in law. See Ofori v Appiah and others \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 583 C. A the headnote of which states thus:  �Held, dismissing the appeal: the general customary rule permitting the tenure of vacant stool land by a subject of a stool was inapplicable to the Ahafo lands under the Mim stool. The peculiar control of the Mimhene over those lands derived historically from the prowess of the people of Mim in abating threats to Ashanti from that area and the role of the Mimhene as a scout at an Ashanti outpost. Consequently, neither the allodial owner, the Akwaboahene, nor the Asantehene could by-pass the Mim stool in the alienation of Mim stool lands. Similarly neither the sub-stools of Ayomso nor Goaso could encroach on neighbouring territory or alienate Mim stool lands. Accordingly since the plaintiff obtained his grant of the land in dispute from the Ayomsohene, he acquired no title to that land.�  Even if Obgojo land were La Stool land the La stool having acquiesced in the acts of ownership by the appellant and his predecessors would not only be estopped at common law by the facts of this case from claiming allodial title to the land but would, as pleaded by the co-defendants/respondents/appellants lose that title to the appellant by reason of section 10(1) and the incidental 10(6) of the Limitation Decree 1972(NRCD54). See GIHOC Refrigeration Household Ltd v Hanna Assi (2005-2008) SC GLR 686, Djin v. Musah Baako ( 2007-2008) SC GLR 686 and Klu v. Darko CA J4/15/2007 S.C dated 25/11/2009  It must be stressed here that it is the allodial title that is in issue and therefore on the facts of this case, clearly the position is that either the appellant or the respondent has that title. It will be an inconsistent verdict in a case such as this where the identity and subject-matter of the allodial title are not in dispute and where no competing contrary facts are proved with regard to any other part of the land to hold that the appellant has title to some parts only but not of the whole.  It must also be stressed that it is the respondent�s case that apart from grants to La citizens no form of grant of La lands can be made to a stranger except by the La Stool. Quite clearly where the alleged allodial owner as here, sits down and watches grants of virgin land to strangers without timeous objection such a person cannot seriously claim an allodial title to the land in question, see Adjei v. Grumah (1982-83) GLR 985 C.A.  For all the foregoing reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the reliefs granted by the trial judge save that she was plainly in error in dismissing the action against the co-defendants/respondents/appellants for the reasons she gave though her conclusion on it is correct.  W. A. ATUGUBA  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  ANSAH, JSC:  This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal which had reversed the judgment of the High Court entered in favour of the defendant therein.  Writ of summons and pleadings  In the said action at the High Court, Accra, the plaintiff who described himself as the occupant of the La Stool, sued the defendant a subject of the said stool, described as the �Onukpa� or �Headman� of Ogbojo village for, as per his amended writ of summons:  �(1) A declaration of title to all Ogbojo lands.  (2) An order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from disposing of Ogbojo lands or any part thereof without the approval and consent of the plaintiff.�  In the course of proceedings, Topp Construction Company Limited, its Managing Director, Mr. Evans Teye, the Evans Teye Estate Development Company Limited were joined to the action as co-defendants.  The pleadings by the plaintiff  In an amended statement of claim the plaintiff averred that:  �(3) The said Ogbojo village is one of the villages under the La Stool and all Ogbojo lands are part of La Stool rural lands.  (4) The said Ogbojo lands together with all other La Stool Rural lands became the property of the La Stool by conquest many centuries ago.  (5) Following the acquisition of the said Ogbogo village and other La villages by the La Stool, aforesaid, they were settled by subjects of the La Stool to which they owe allegiance and which has always been the allodial owner of such lands.  (6) According to La custom, the Head of any La rural village may make grants of La Stool rural lands to subjects of the La Stool for subsistence farming only and for the construction of dwelling houses for themselves but all other grants of such lands can only be validly made with the prior approval of the La Mantse.�  As to the events that triggered off the action, the plaintiff pleaded that:  �(7) recently, the defendant has been asserting a claim to Ogbojo lands and has insisted that such lands belong to him and his family absolutely to the extent that he does not recognise the allodial title of the La Stool to Ogbojo lands.�  The plaintiff described the boundaries of Ogbojo village lands title to which he claimed by this action to be as follows:  �(8) . . . on the South by Mpehuasem lands, on the North by the lands of Ashalley Botwe and Sraha, on the East by the Bejin lands and on the West b by Nkwantanang lands.�  The pleadings by the defendant  In his statement of defence the defendant admitted his status of being a subject of the La Stool but denied the paragraph 3 as pleaded by the plaintiff and quoted above. He pleaded poignantly that Nii Jonathan Ephraim Sai Obodai was the head of the composite Anahor and Jirase families of Ogbojo; he was also the head or Mantse of Ogbojo Village. The defendant pleaded further that the composite Anahor and Jirase families founded and settled at the village of Ogbojo. These family members originally hailed from La and the lands aforementioned belonged to the composite families absolutely; the defendant denied that the La Stool is the owner thereof.  The pleadings by the co-defendants  The 1st, 2nd and 3rd co-defendants filed a similar statement of defence and pleaded that when the 2nd approached the immediate predecessor of the respondent, Nii Anyetei Kwakwranya II for land, Nii directed him to go to Jonathan Ephraim Sai Obodai for a grant of land at Ogbojo for estate development which grant was made to the 1st co-defendant. By a deed dated 2nd June 1979, between the said Jonathan Obodai as the lawful head and representative of the Anahor and Jirase families of Ogbojo and the 1st co-defendant, and registered as No. 4761/1968, the land described therein was conveyed to the first defendant company. Following this grant the co-defendant went into possession of the land and exercised proprietary rights over it. By these acts the respondent was stopped from challenging 1st co-defendant�s action was statute barred having not been commenced within 12 years from the date when the cause of action arose.  Issues settled for trial  At the close of pleadings, the plaintiff filed summons for directions made of 20 issues, followed by several amendments to their pleadings by the parties and the joinder of co-defendants to the action, after which the suit eventually proceeded to full trial.  At the center of the dispute was the issue as to who own the allodial title to the Ogbojo lands, the plaintiff or the defendant?  The evidence of the plaintiff-respondent:  With regard to the acquisition of Ogbojo lands, the plaintiff/respondent�s evidence at the trial was given by Nii Sowa Odaifio; it was that:  �Ogbojo is a village on La Stool land around Madina. The first person who settled at Ogbojo is Okotse Adjah who hailed from La Anahor. He founded this as a village and settled there. He being the founder of the village and settled there. As a founder, he takes care of the village for the La Stool the successors of Okotse Adjah continued in that vain (sic). The relationship between the elders of Ogbojo and the La Stool in respect of sale of land is that whenever anyone wants to buy from any of the La villages the headman or elder consults the La Stool and then the grant is made. The La chief signs the documents. The Ogbojo lands because (sic) La Stool lands when the La Mantse called Nii Odai Atsen II and his Mankralo Okang Mashie fought the Nunguas and conquered them and took the land. This was in 1690. This story was told me by my grandfather and other elders of La. We were made to understand that at the time of the war only the Nunguas were occupying all the lands. When they were conquered and driven away . . . It was after this other people came to live on the land. It was when they increased in numbers that they formed quarters. The defendant Nii Ago Sai hails from La Anohor. The Anohor quarter was not part of La during the time of the conquest. I cannot say where the Anahor people were during the time of the conquest. They had not come to La then. I understand that the Anahor people joined La in 1730. We were told that it was Nii Akotse Adjah who settled at Ogbojo gave that name to the village��  This witness said he was the Otsiame (i.e. the linquist) of La Stool and that Okotse Adjah and his successors settled on Ogbojo lands as caretakers of the La Stool and consulted the stool for alienation of lands which stool prepared documents for the grantee. So if the appellant granted the land to the 2nd co-defendant, then he did for and on behalf of the La stool. If on the other hand the elders of Ogbojo signed documents for the 2nd co-defendant, then they were wrong and the council of quarter heads or �Akutsei- Atsemei� objected to the grant to the 2nd co-defendant, which was evidenced by a letter dated 10 August 1987 and marked Exhibit A  Under cross-examination, this witness said he knew Ogbojo was inhabited by the Anahor and Dzirase people.  The PW1 was Nii Okine Akko, a member of the La Traditional Council. In that position he got to know of a grant of land at Ogbojo to Evans Teye the 2nd co-defendant, but the elders asked him to vacate the land because they would not give it to him. They informed him of this through a letter written to him in 1987 and tendered in evidence at Exhibit A. the PW1 was emphatic he was not a member of the La Traditional Council that wrote Exhibit A and that the La rural lands were owned by the La Stool.  The PW2, Emmanuel Kwaku Torgbo, repeated the evidence that Nii Okotse Adjah settled at Ogbojo but he did not claim it as family land. He tendered three judgments in Exhibits B, B1 and B2 as well as Exhibits C and C1, the Gold Coast Service list of 1971 and 1921 that showed that the Ogbojo lands are La Stool lands. This witness denied signing any document as a witness for Obodai Sai as the chief of Ogbojo.  Dr. Joseph Paul Okang gave evidence as PW3 and tendered a map of La Stool lands as Exhibit D, which was given him by the plaintiff to copy from an old one.  Evidence of defendant/appellant  The evidence of the defendant/appellant was given through a representative, Joseph Nii Torgbor Obodai III, who described himself as the present chief of Ogbojo. He denied the plaintiff�s claim and asserted Ogbojo village was founded by Nii Okotse Adjah also known as Torgbotse Adja, a hunter, herbalist and farmer who practised his vocation by collecting herbs at a place under an Ogbeje or Ogbojo tree. He also lived under the tree where he was joined by Nii Okangfio.  It was descendants of these two people who became the principal elders of the present day Ogbojo village. With the passage of time the descendants multiplied. Okotse Adjah had as his sons, Torgbor and Sai Adja the latter of whom gave birth to the father of Joseph Nii Torgbor Obodai III the appellants� representative who gave evidence for the appellant. He was the chief of Ogbojo. From this humble beginning the Ogbojo settlement sprung up and later grew into the present day Ogbojo now in dispute.  The appellant supported his evidence with documentary evidence in the form of Exhibits 1 (minutes of meeting), 1A (indenture), 2 (letters), 2A (deed of variation), 3 (letter on the ownership of Ogbojo lands by La Anahor Nii Mankralo to Nii Kote Amli III), 3A (Land Certificate for Evans Teye Estate Development Limited), 4 (indenture dated 4/4/98 between Numo Adjah family of Ogbojo as lessors and Richard K. Asiamah as lessee), 5 (Receipts for the payment of land) 5A (Plan of land of Ogbojo), 5B (Receipt for �) and 6 (letter for �), Exhibit 11-11 F (Indentures for Adofo Kissi by Nii Jonathan Ephraim Obodai the Ogbojo Mantse).  Evidence by the DW2 under cross-examination was that Ogbojo was for the La Mantse.  The parties gave evidence both oral and documentary and called witnesses in support of their respective cases. In a nutshell, the plaintiff/respondent claimed absolute ownership of Ogbojo lands through conquest of the Nungua�s several centuries ago; whereas the defendant/appellant traced their ownership of the same land through being founded by Okotse Adjah from Anahor and Okaifio of Djirase the forbearers of the composite Anahor and Jirase families of Ogbojo who originally hailed from La. Furthermore, Nii Jonathan Ephraim Sai Obodai was the head of the said composite family. The Ogbojo village with its surrounding lands is exclusively owned by the composite families of Ogbojo since time immemorial.  The judgment by the trial court  The trial judge, Mrs. Agnes Dordzie J. summarized the respective cases of the parties and held that the plaintiff�s (respondent�s) case could not hold; she dismissed it and entered judgment for the appellants. She also awarded costs of �8million to the appellant and �6million for the co-defendants.  The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judgment on several grounds. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial court and granted perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant from disposing of Ogbojo lands without the approval of the plaintiff.  The defendant/respondent appealed against the whole judgment of the Court of Appeal, on the original ground that:  �(i) the judgment is against the weight of the evidence on the record�.  No other ground(s) has or have been added upon the receipt of the record so that remains the only ground of appeal before us. However, the sold ground of appeal was broken into sub-heads, namely that:  �(a) The Court of Appeal�s acceptance of the Respondent�s historical account on Ogbojo land is against the account of the Appellants when the onus of proof rest on the Respondent is unsupportable by the evidence.  (b) The Court of Appeal�s holding that the Respondent is not bound by the unchallenged evidence on record that the Respondent�s predecessor, the former La Mantse, had asserted that Ogbojo lands belong to the appellant�s family is erroneous.  (c) The Court of Appeal erred in refusing the unchallenged evidence on record that the Appellant�s family had settled and lived on Ogbojo land for over 200 years and dealt with as well as disposed of portions of the land without the consent of the La Stool and hence barred from claiming title to the whole Ogbojo lands by reason of the statute of Limitation.  (d) The Court of Appeal misconstrued the ratio decidendi of the decision in Owusu v Mantse of Labadi and Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd and misapplied them against the unchallenged evidence in this case that land first settled on by individual and families are differently owned from lands acquired by stools and given to subjects of the stool to cultivate�.  Counsel for the respondent cast serious aspersions on how the grounds of appeal were couched for after appealing on the omnibus ground, the appellant was limited to argue on the facts only but by the sub groupings the appellant was arguing on points of law, something deprecated in Brown v Quashiga \[�\]. In my opinion, I do not think Brown v Quashiga supra was wrongly decided, but the principle does not apply in this case for, the so-called sub groupings were matters dealing with the facts and not law as submitted by the respondent.  I shall in this opinion refer to the plaintiff in the High Court action as the appellant in the Court of Appeal and the respondent herein, the defendant in the High Court, as the appellant herein.  It was trite learning that an appeal to this court against a judgment of the Court of Appeal is by way of rehearing and this court was bound to consider comprehensively the entire evidence before coming to a conclusion on the matter. This being an action for a declaration of title to land, the burden of proof and persuasion remained on the plaintiffs to prove conclusively, on a balance of probabilities; they were entitled to their claim of title. This they could do by proving on the balance of probabilities the essentials of their root of title and method of acquiring title to the area in dispute, the Ogbojo lands.  Several judgments  The respondent pleaded several judgments in their favor which will refer to presently, in his effort to discharge the burden of proof on them. This case is founded on and embedded in Labadi customary land law as expressed in cases like  (1) Adoaku v Nyamalor \[1963\] 1 GLR 279, SC, which decided that:  �(2) The customary law in Labadi in respect of alienation of quarter land was obviously similar to that obtaining in Osu, a neighboring state or division�.  At page 280 it was contended by the appellant in that case that Labadi was divided into seven quarters and each quarter had its �quarter lands�, as well as �outskirts lands adjoining the quarter and that it is the head of the quarter who has the right to deal with the outskirt lands of the quarter and that the custom at Labadi is that the head of the quarters gives out land to people requiring portions. The Labadi Mantse never gives out land as the lands belong to various quarters.  At page 281 the evidence of Asafoatse Tutuani II on the custom in Labadi in respect of alienation of quarter lands and outskirts lands was that the Labadi Mantse had no authority to alienate land in dispute for it was attached to the quarters.  In a very recent case of Agyei Osae v Adjeifio \[2007-08\] SCGLR 499, the illustrious Brobbey JSC said at page 508 that though Akwei v Awuletey (supra), dealt with Osu lands, the principles enunciated therein applied to lands in Labadi and Teshie. I affirm him on this.  2\. Another Labadi case worth mentioning was Nii Adjei Onano v Okoi Noi and Nii Andamafio (DC Land) �48-�51, 97: It dealt with issues pertaining to grants of stool lands to subjects by head stool and quarters-grants to subjects can be done by the quarter stool with the rider that the head stool has the right to be informed. (Civ. App. No. 22/49 dated 30th May, 1950, the La Mantse is the only person entitled to La custom to grant lands to subjects of the Stool, and which he does with the consent of his Divisional Council); the La Mantse was the owner of La Stool lands and exercised rights over Stool lands: see Boi Owusu and Dsani v La Mantse, unrep. Div. Court; upheld by the WACA in 1 WACA 278.  3 In yet another Labadi case, W. W. Saleeby v O. M. Nortey D.C. (Land) �48-�51, 404 a judgment by Jackson J, given on 21st December 1951, on grant of lands to subjects by the La Mantse, the court held according to the head note to the report that  : (1) The La Mantse was the only person entitled to grant the lands to subjects of the stool. He did this with the consent of his Divisional Council.�  Ollennu wrote at page 17 on the �Acquisition of Absolute or Paramount Ownership� in his �Principles of Customary Land Law in Ghana�, that the 4 methods for the acquisition of the absolute ownership of land by a stool are stated in Ohimen v Adjei 1957 2 WALR 279 to be as follows: conquest and subsequent settlement thereon and cultivation by subjects of the stool; discovery by hunters or pioneers of the stool of unoccupied land and subsequent settlement thereof and use thereof by the stool and its subjects; gift to the stool; purchase by the stool.  The authorities are agreed that the customary land law in Labadi is similar to what pertains in Osu and it is that customary land law that we shift our focus to now. Our first port of call is Akwei v Awuletey \[1960\] GLR 231 SC. That case stated there were three categories of lands known as follows:  �1. Quarter land which, is land within the quarter of the town.  2\. Outskirts land which is land immediately adjacent to or  continuous to a quarter  3\. Rural land which is all other stool lands which are neither quarter  or outskirts lands�  It was further held in the Akwei v Awuletey (supra), at 236 that:  �the Osu Mantse � as occupant of the Osu Stool is the proper person entitled to sue and be sued in respect of lands title to which is vested in Osu Stool � (238). To this general principle however is the qualified exception in respect of quarter lands and outskirt lands attached to these quarters in respect of which he cannot make a valid grant without prior consultation with the head and elders of the quarter concerned�.  At page 239 of the report the Supreme Court in Akwei v Awuletey (supra), purported to give a resume of the judgments of the West African Court of Appeal and the Ghana Court of Appeal enunciating the principles relating to alienation of Osu stool lands including portions thereof known as quarter outskirt and rural lands and concluded at page 241 that:  �This can be gathered from the evidence of witnesses that Osu subjects to whom grants a land within a quarter may have been made by the quarter headman cannot alienate such lands to strangers (i.e. non-Osu people) except by deed executed by the Osu Mantse.�  This had never been the case of the parties in this appeal at all, that a quarter headman or even the Mantse had granted any stool land to the appellant who in turn alienated it to a stranger so defined. Therefore the respondent could not complain that the appellant lacked the authority to alienate the land to the co-defendants without the La Mantse validly.  A general statement of customary land law is that for a piece of land to belong to a head stool, it must first of all belong to or be attached to a sub-stool or quarter under the head-stool or head-skin. Therefore to say that any land, particularly land in the occupation of members of a quarter or sub-stool, belongs to a head-stool, and in the same breath say that that very land is not attached or does not belong to a sub-stool or quarter is to fall into a grievous error; it is a contradiction in terms. Such a view is against all principles of customary land tenure. A head stool can never have the absolute title in any land vested in it, unless it can show first all that that land is attached to sub-stool or quarter under that head-stool, or head-skin. Thus speaking, Christian Boi Owusu & anor v The Manche of Labadi (1933) 1 WACA 278, is authority for the legal principle that to say because of a stool�s absolute ownership of land no individual or sub-stool or quarter can claim against the head-stool a right to administer a piece of stool land, is a grievous error. That case decided as far back as in 1933 by WACA that Nkwatanang village is part of La rural lands owned by the La Mantse.  I am in entire agreement with the comments by Atiguba and Dotse JJSC on this case in their judgments which I had the privilege to read beforehand.  The trial court also referred to Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 314 in her judgment as binding on her it being a judgment of the Supreme Court. She said whether La Rural Lands are La Stool Lands and whether grants of such lands could be made without the consent of the La Stool were some of the issues decided in that case. She said further the Supreme Court made in roads in the case law as regards the position of the La Stool and its relation to La rural lands and grants made by the sub-stools of such lands. She further delivered herself as follows:  � As regards the question whether a family can own any of the La rural lands this what the Supreme Court has to say per Taylor JSC at page 352 � I am not prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case that La rural lands belong to the La Stool. Both cases however did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land until the facts grounding the ownership are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own the land.� (e.s.)  It ought to be appreciated that Taylor JSC happened to be in the majority in the Nartey case which majority judgment was affirmed on review and reported sub nom Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Limited v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598 SC.  This appeal provided the opportunity to probe or test and providing an answer to the issue raised by Taylor JSC.  The previous judgments in Christian Boi Owusu v Mantse of Labadi (supra), dealt with �Nkwatanang� lands, Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Limited (supra), with �Frafraha� lands and said these lands were La rural lands owned by the La Mantse.  The third case tendered in evidence by the respondent Exhibit B2, was:  �In the Re Public Lands (Leasehold) Ordinance CAP (138)  And in the matter of Land acquired for the Service by the Colony and Ashanti at Mile 9 on the Accra-Dodowa Road for Presbyterian Secondary School.�  1\. La Mantse.  2\. The Teshie Mantse  3\. The Nungua Mantse --- Claimants�, unreported High Court, Accra dated 13th February, 1963, coram, Acolatse J.  As the title suggested, there were three stools including the stool of Labadi each claiming title to the area intended for acquisition for the intended Presbyterian Secondary School, to wit, �Mile 9 on the Accra-Dodowa road�. After taking evidence from each claimant stool, Acolatse J held at page 15 of his judgment that:  �For the reasons I have given above on the merit of each claimant herein, I hold the La Mantse has established his claim to the land in dispute as the owner thereof as against the Stools of Teshie and Nungua.  Judgment accordingly for the La Mantse with cost�.  The picture painted by the respondent was that these previous judgments established that Nkwatanang, Frafraha and Mile 9 on the Accra-Dodowa Road and their environs were declared to be owned by the La Stool. The question is did it mean the Ogbojo village in this dispute was also covered by these judgments in the first place and if it was, could a family nevertheless own the allodia title on the stool land?  I have stated the facts in dispute as between the parties each claiming Ogbojo lands to be his. To recap, whereas the respondent claimed the land for the La Stool through an acquisition by conquest of the Nunguas in 1690, the appellants traced its acquisition by Nii Okotse Adjah the hunter, herbalist and farmer who founded the settlement under an Ogbojo tree. The respondent did not deny that Nii Okotse founded Ogbojo village. In a very recent case of Agyei Osae v Adjeifio \[2007-08\] SCGLR 499, the illustrious Brobbey JSC said at page 508 that though Akwei v Awuletey (supra), dealt with Osu lands, the principles enunciated therein applied to lands in Labadi and Teshie. I affirm him on this for he was amply supported by Aduako v Nyamalor (supra).  In Agyei Osae v Adjeifio (supra) this court speaking unanimously through Brobbey JSC said that:  �It is established by the evidence on record that the founder of Otinshie Village was from the Krobo Quarter. The right, which the Osae Family will hold in Otinshie Village lands, will however be an absolute title not a usufructuary title as held by the Court of Appeal. In this connection, the Otinshie Village should only be the area which the plaintiff�s ancestors had effectively reduced into their possession, i.e. their building, farm lands, cemetery, etc�, see page 508.  The plaintiff in Agyei Osae failed in his action because he had claimed title to the �vast land� of Teshie without specifying the boundaries of what he claimed to be for his family. Even though Agyei Osae was a Teshie land case dealing with Otinshie village it has some close relation with Ogbojo village and La land case for, as noted, the governing principles are the same.  It was to be appreciated that these lines of cases dealt with the customary land law appertaining to the Osu, Teshie and the people of Labadi. Therefore substituting Osu for Labadi, or vice versa, a statement can be made that from the weight of judicial authorities though rural lands may belong to a head stool, the rights which a family can hold in such lands will be the absolute title and not the usufructuary title, especially of the area which the ancestors had effectively reduced into their possession. But whatever it is, everything depends on facts peculiar to a particular case and proved in evidence. In this case, the evidence was that Ogbojo village was founded by Okotse Adjah and Nii Okaifio, who on the evidence hailed from La; their descendants comprised the Anahor Jirase family, the occupants of Ogbojo village.  The parties in this case relied on events that were alleged to have taken place several centuries ago to support their claims, for example, the appellant relied on first settlement by Nii Okotse Adjah of La Anahor and Nii Ankamafio under the Ogbeje or Ogbojo tree whereas the respondent relied on a conquest of the Nunguas in a war in 1690. The onus was on the respondent to prove his method of acquisition of the area in dispute conclusively and that he confirmed the settlement under the tree by Okotse Adjah in the evidence by the PW 1, Nii Sowa Odaifio, the Otsiame (linquist) of La and a representative of the La Mantse himself and who from all probabilities was presumed to know the history of the land claimed by his principal and customary overlord, supported the case of the appellant on such a vital point like the first settlement by Nii Okotse Adjah on the land in dispute. The law is settled that:  �Where the evidence of one party on an issue in a suit is corroborated by witnesses of his opponent, whilst that of his opponent on the same issue stands uncorroborated even by his own witnesses, a Court ought not to accept the uncorroborated version in preference to the uncorroborated one, unless for some good reason (which must appear on the face of the judgment) the Court finds the uncorroborated version incredible or impossible�, per Ollennu J. in Tsrifo v Duah VIII \[1959\] G. L. R. 63 at 64.  The result was that there was evidence that Okotse Adjah of the Anahor family was the first to settle on Ogbojo and gave that village its name. After the settlement, the village grew in size and population into the present day Ogbojo township.  It was not disputed that the root of title of the parties was founded on traditional history, events dating as far back as a conquest in 1960 by the Labadis of Nunguas or settlement under an Ogbojo tree in 1730 or thereabouts. Those were the days when writing of dates was unknown in these parts and history of tradition was transmitted from generation to generation via word of mouth and as ones memory could serve any purpose. In those circumstances the law was that:  �The most satisfactory method of testing traditional history is by examining it in the light of much more recent facts as can be established by evidence in order to establish which of two conflicting statements of tradition is more probably correct. Where there is a conflict of traditional history one side or other must be mistaken, yet both may be honest in their beliefs, for honest mistakes may occur in the course of transmission of the traditions down the generations. In such circumstances, and particularly where (Native) Courts below have differed, an Appeal Court must review the evidence and draw their own inferences from the established facts: the demeanour of the witnesses before the trial court is of little guide to the truth,� per Lord Denning in Adjeibi-Kojo v Bosie and Another (3 W.A.L.R.) 257 at 260 (e.s.)�  The respondent herein, plaintiff in the trial court, tendered a map in Exhibit D through a surveyor to show the boundaries of La rural lands. The surveyor was the PW3, Dr. Paul Okang, a retired teacher of KNUST and a member of the La Stool Lands Committee. The trial judge in assessing this witness said he scored zero or very low marks for she did not think she could attach much weight to the map he produced in court. Her reasons were that he admitted he did not take part in demarcating the land, he was only given an old map by the plaintiff respondent to copy and he did just that. He wrought much damage to his cause when he admitted he would not know whether if the old map was genuine or not. Moreover, the map was a recent preparation made in 2001. When it was considered that the writ initiating the action was issued on 18/1/94, it became plain the map was prepared for the purpose of this litigation. That act by the PW3, copying an old map of an area in dispute on the instructions of a plaintiff in a suit, are self-serving and the law was that it did not permit a party to prove his case by previous acts in his favour. The principle is succinctly stated in Nii Abossey Okai II v Nii Ayikai II 12 W.A.C.A. at page 36 by Beoku Betts, J., that:  �It is recognized law that a person cannot by his acts prove anything in his favour, and these dealings with the property are therefore not of same value as admissions against interest.� See Civil Appeal No. 86/62, G.A.K. Glala & or. v Anku Ayihoe Dzaha & ors (unreported), CA, 26th June 1967, Written Judgment, January-December 1967.  The appellants tendered exhibits 11, 11A-F, to support their claim of ownership of Ogbojo. These documents testified of grants of portions of Ogbojo lands by the Anahor and Dzirase families from 1978. They also tendered the arbitration proceedings before the La Mankralo between the PW2 Emmanuel Kwaku Torgbofio and Nai-Nye Ama over claims of ownership of Ogbojo lands, which arbitration published an award that the lands were for the Ogbojo chief and his people.  There was further evidence for the appellant that Nii Anyetei Kwakwranya II, an immediate past chief of Labadi, acknowledged the appellant and his people as the owners of Ogbojo lands when the co-defendants approached him for land for estate development, for the land belonged to them. Nii Kwakwranya II directed the co-defendant to the chief of Ogbojo who granted the land to them in 1979. All documents evidencing the grant of land were executed on behalf of Sai Obodai and Numo Okan Adjetey families of Anahor and Dzirase. The La Mantse was neither a party nor a signatory to the documents. The Court of Appeal did not agree with the trial court that the acts of Nii Kwakwaranya bound the La Stool. That court did not dispute it that the evidence by the appellant on what Nii Kwakwaranya II did; but only said the stool was not bound by them. With the greatest respect to the Court, it erred egregiously for the law was that:  �Further, a reigning chief is the agent of the stool he occupies while he remains on the stool: see Ababio v Tutu (1962) GLR 489, S.C. which held that stool is a corporation sole a legal entity which is represented by a reigning chief. See also Quarm v Yankah II (1930) 1 WACA 80 at 83, which was cited in Ababio v Tutu (supra), and wherein Deane CJ at p83, had this to say:� Since the conception of the stool has always been accepted in the courts of this colony is that it is an entity which never dies a corporation sole like the crown and that while the occupant of the Stool may come and go, the stool goes on forever. When therefore the respondent is sued as representing the stool since he is the present occupant he is not sued as the successor of the present holder, but only as the person for the time being representing something that has never changed, he is the agent through whom the stool acts as at present while the former chief was  If Nii Adjah Kwao II was agent for the stool in 1959 and acted on behalf of the stool, then, he had capacity to act for the stool at the time Exhibit A was made in 1973 and his acts would bind the Stool�, per Bamford Addo JSC in Republic v Lands Commission \[1998-99\] SCGLR 677 at 685, cited by the appellant in his statement of case.  The respondent did not challenge this evidence by the appellant and even if they did it was bound to fail fro the respondents evidence was that it was for these acts by Nii Kwakwaranya II that he was destooled as the La Mantse. Those acts bound the stool just like the present occupant the La Mantse, the respondent.  The inference must be obvious that truly Nii Anyatei Kwakwaranya II did direct the co-defendants to the Ogbojo chief and his elders fro land for they owned it. The respondents did not agree with what their overlord did and they claimed they destooled him for having done so. This court is not called upon to make a determination as to whether or not he was properly destooled. Until a court of competent jurisdiction declared the acts of Nii Kwakwaranya II null and void it was valid and had a binding effect not only on himself but his successors, assigns, privies and those tracing through him.  The respondent tendered the Gold Coast Civil Service List in Exhibit C and C1 which mentioned Ogbojo as a village under La division, but this was countered by the appellant that not all towns and villages mentioned in the list were necessarily for Labadi and cited the village of Maalejon as example. Lawyers D. O. Lamptey and Adjei Adjetey wrote exhibits 9 and 8 respectively to state that the land of Maalejon was not for Labadi.  The evidence of the appellant was buoyed by acts of ownership like grants of lands to strangers covered by Exhibits 11, 11A-F. Whilst these per se would not confer ownership or title on the grantors, they would go a long way to buttress a claim of title to the land granted. Evidence of recent acts of ownership by the respondent was nil or if any at all significant and not of any weight.  I have read the record of appeal, several times over and the conclusion I came to was that the appeal be allowed for the judgment of the Court of Appeal was against the weight of the evidence and the law, except to say that the High Court erred in setting aside the joinder of the co-defendants to the suit. The judgment of the Court of Appeal to restore them was right and affirmed. Save that, I agree that the appeal be allowed, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the trial High Court.  J. ANSAH  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  OWUSU (MS), JSC:  I have had the opportunity to read the Judgment of my respected brother and I wholly agree that the appeal be allowed. However, I have a few observations to make.  The plaintiff claimed the reliefs endorsed on his writ as follows:  �Declaration of title to all Ogbojo lands.�  2\. �Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant from disposing of Ogbojo lands or any part thereof without the approval and consent of the plaintiff.�  The facts have been sufficiently set down by my brother Dotse J.S. C. in his judgment and I do not find it necessary to repeat them. The main contention between the parties is who owns the allodial title to Ogbojo lands. In the summons for directions in the trial court among the many issues filed are issues (f) and (g) i.e.  �(f) whether or not Ogbojo village is one of the village under the La Stool and  �(g) whether or not all Ogbojo lands are part of La Stool rural lands�.  The plaintiff, in his capacity as occupant of La Stool, claims that Ogbojo is part of La Stool rural lands acquired by the La Stool by conquest.  The Defendant disputed the plaintiff�s claim that Ogbojo lands are La Stool lands or village. According to him, Ogbojo lands are family lands belonging to the ANAHOR and DZIRASE families of Ogbojo and that the lands were founded by settlement.  At the end of the trial, Judgment was entered in favour of the Defendant and thus the plaintiff�s claim was dismissed. The trial court was of the view that the Defendant led sufficient evidence in support of his claim and found as a fact that Ogbojo lands are properties of Anahor and Dzirase Families. This is what the learned Judge said:  �when these sets of facts are put on scale, the facts supporting the defendant�s assertions far outweigh that of the plaintiff. I am inclined to believe that the plaintiff is now putting up this claim of ownership of the Ogbojo lands because of the commercial value those lands have in recent times acquired.  With the evidence of the defendant supported by the acknowledgement of the former occupant of the La Stool and the La Mankralo, coupled with plaintiff�s own witness p.w. 2 Emmanuel Torgborfio Kwaku�s signatures on indentures executed by the chief and elders of Ogbojo admitting that they are the owners of the land, I have no cause to reject the fact that the Ogbojo lands are family lands belonging to the Anahor and Dzirase families of Ogbojo. I do hereby declare the land in dispute in this case described as Ogbojo lands the property of the Anahor and Dzirase families of Ogbojo. The property being family property the consent of the La Stool is not needed in making grants of the said land.�  The learned trial Judge, arrived at this conclusion, after ably evaluating the evidence led before her by the parties.  Dissatisfied with her decision, the plaintiff appealed to the court of appeal on the following grounds among others  �(1) The Judgment is manifestly against the weight of evidence adduced at the trial.�  �(2) The learned trial judge erred in law when she dismissed the case against the co-defendants on the ground that the pleadings did not disclose any cause of action against them.�  �(3) The learned trial Judge erred in law when she misconstrued the Judgment in NARTEY VRS MECHANICAL LLOYD and erroneously relied on the misconstruction to give Judgment to the defendant.�  �(4) The learned trial Judge erred in law when she held that the plaintiff is stopped by conduct from laying to the land in dispute in the action.�  �(7) The learned trial Judge erred in law when she relied on Exhibits II, IIA-IIF to give Judgment to the defendant when the basis of the said exhibits is defective.�  The court of Appeal per Douse J. A. unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside the Judgment of the trial court.  Dissatisfied with that Judgment, the Defendant/Respondent and Appellant in this case on the very day that the judgment was delivered filed an appeal against it on the omnibus ground that:  �(i) The judgment is against the weight of the evidence on the record.�  No additional grounds were however filed as indicated in the Notice of Appeal. He is asking for reversal of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal.  In arguing the appeal, the Appellant sought to demonstrate why the Judgment is against the weight of evidence under four subheads as follows:  �(a) The Court of Appeal�s acceptance of the Respondent�s Historical account on Ogbojo lands as against the account of the Appellant�s when the Onus of proof rest on the Respondent is unsupportable by the evidence.�  �(b) The court of Appeal�s holding that the Respondent is not bound by the unchallenged evidence on record that the Respondent�s predecessor the former La Mantse had asserted that Ogbojo Lands belong to the Appellant family is erroneous.�  �(c) The court of Appeal erred in refusing unchallenged evidence on record that the Appellant�s family had settled and lived on Ogbojo Land for over 200 years and dealt with it as well as deposed (sic) of portions of the land without the consent of the La Stool and hence barred the La Stool from claiming title to the whole Ogbojo lands by reason of the statute of Limitation.�  �(d) The court of Appeal misconstrued the ratio decidendi of the decision in OWUSU VRS MANCHE OF LABADI and NARTEY VRS MECHANICAL LLOYD and misapplied them against the unchallenged evidence in this case that land first settled on by individual and families are differently owned from lands acquired by stools and given to subjects of the stool to cultivate.�  An Appellant who appeals on a ground that the Judgment is against the weight of evidence has a burden to satisfy the appellate court that indeed the Judgment is unreasonable having regard to the evidence on record. See the case of AMPOMAH VRS VOLTA RIVER AUTHORITY \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 28.  In TUAKWA VRS BOSOM \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 61, the court per Sophia Akuffo, JSC held that:  �an appeal is by way of re-hearing particularly where the Appellant alleges in his notice of appeal that the decision of the trial court is against the weight of the evidence. In such a case, - - - it is incumbent upon an appellate court, in a civil case, to analyse the entire record of appeal, take into account the testimonies and all documentary evidence adduced at the trial before arriving at its decision, so as to satisfy itself that on a balance of probabilities, the conclusions of the trial Judge are reasonably or amply supported by the evidence . . . �  See also the case of AKUFFO-ADDO VRS CATHELINE \[1992\] 1 GLR 372  What evidence did the Plaintiff/Respondent herein lead in support of his claim for declaration of title? It is his case that the Ogbojo village and its surrounding lands form part of La rural lands and that these lands belong to the Stool, same having been conquered from the people of Nungua in 1690. These lands according to him, stretch from the foot of the Akwapim hills to the place where the La Township is presently situate.  In prove of this, the plaintiff tendered a map marked Exhibit D through p.w.3 his surveyor to show the boundaries of La rural lands. He also tendered the Judgment in the C. B. OWUSU & ANOTHER VRS MANCHE of LABADI 1 \[W.A.C.A\] 278 and two other Judgments, exhibits �B� and �B2� which according to him, establish the same principle that La rural lands are Stool Lands.  Ex �C1�, a copy of the Gold Coast civil service list from the National Archives was also tendered to show that Ogbojo was classified as a village under the Labadi Division of Accra in the colonial administration. In short this is the evidence led by the plaintiff in support of his claim.  Against this evidence is that of the Defendant/Appellant herein. According to him Ogbojo lands are family lands belonging to the Anahor and Dzirase families of Ogbojo. He narrated the history of how the land in dispute was founded. That one Okotse Adjah of La Anahor founded the land and later Okangfio of La Dzirase went and settled with him. Together they established Ogbojo village. Descendants of these two men are the principal elders of the Ogbojo village. They inherited the Ogbojo lands and were responsible for alienating the lands without any reference to the La Stool for many years without any objection from any quarter. In support of this, documents of various grants of Ogbojo lands made by Anahor and Dzirase families since 1978 were tendered as Exs �II, IIA-IIF�.  The Appellant further testified to evidence given by the chief of Ogbojo and his elders before a special National Investigation Committee on Labadi Stool Land affairs before which the chief laid claim to Ogbojo lands for himself and his people. In a dispute between another group of people among whom was Emmanuel Torgbofio Kwaku p. w. 2 in the trial, who claimed to be true descendants of Okatse Adjah and therefore true owners of Ogbojo lands, the Mankralo of La in an arbitration declared the Ogbojo Chief and his people the true owners of the lands. This decision was tendered as Ex �3�.  To crown it all, the Appellant gave evidence of acknowledgement of the title of the Ogbojo Chief and his people to Ogbojo lands by the Respondent�s predecessor Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya II. The evidence is that the 1st co-defendant approached the then chief of La, Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya for a land he had found along the road to Pantang Hospital. He advised him against going for that land because there was litigation over that piece of land. He told him he will consult the chief and elders of Ogbojo to see if they could help him. The chief directed him to the Appellant and requested him to sell part of the land to them. The Appellant made grants to them in 1979 and executed documents on behalf of Numo Sai Obodai and Numo Okpan Adjetey families of Anahor and Dzirase. The La Mantse was never part of the signatories to the documents. He therefore claims that the Respondent is estopped from laying any claims to the Ogbojo lands.  Before the Court of Appeal were these conflicting claims and the evidence led by each of the parties.  �An appellate court must not disturb findings of fact made by a trial court, even if the appellate court would have come to a different conclusion, unless the findings of fact made by the trial Judge were wholly unsupportable by the evidence. Therefore, where the evidence was conflicting, the decision of the trial court as to which version of the facts to accept was to be preferred, and the appellate court might substitute its own view only in the most glaring of cases. That was primarily because the trial Judge had the advantage of listening to the entire evidence and watching the reactions and demeanor of the parties and their witnesses.� See the case of In Re OKINE (DECEASED; DODOO and Another VRS OKINE and Others \[2003 � 2004\] 582  In the instant case, was there any justification for the court of Appeal to have set aside the positive finding by the trial court that Ogbojo lands/village are family properties of Anahor and Dzirase families as opposed to the claim of the Respondent that they form part of La-Stool lands?  On the record, that finding is amply supported by the evidence.  On the authority of TUAKWA VRS BOSOM already referred to, before the court of Appeal it was incumbent upon the court to analyse the entire record of appeal, take into account the testimonies and all documentary evidence adduced at the trial before arriving at its decision, so as to satisfy itself that on a balance of probabilities the conclusions of the trial Judge are reasonable or amply supported by the evidence . . .  Under section11(1) of the Evidence Decree now Act, (N. R. C. D.) 323 of 1975, �for the purpose of this Act, the burden of producing evidence means the obligation of a party to introduce sufficient evidence to avoid a ruling on the issue against that party�.  11 (4) states that:  �In other circumstances, the burden of producing evidence requires a party to produce sufficient evidence which on the totality of the evidence, leads a reasonable mind to conclude that the existence of the fact was more probable than its non-existence�.  The plaintiff in the trial court failed to discharge the burden of proof and for that reason that ground of appeal that the Judgment was manifestly against the weight of evidence should have been dismissed.  In the case of C. B. Owusu, there was sufficient evidence before the court that the land in dispute i.e. Nkwantanang formed part of a large area of land originally acquired by the Labadi people by conquest.  I am afraid that is not the case in the instant case.  Again in Ex �B2�, in RE PUBLIC LANDS (leasehold) Ordinance CAP 138  AND IN THE MATTER OF LAND ACQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE BY THECOLONY AND ASHANTI SITUATE AT MILE POST 9 ON ACCRA �DODOWA ROAD FOR PRESBYTERIAN SECONDARY SCHOOL,  1\. THE LA MANTSE }  2\. THE TESHIE MANTSE } CLAIMANTS  3\. THE NUNGUA MANTSE }  the three claimants laid claim to the land involved and after the trial this was the decision of Acolatse J.  �for the reasons I have given above on the merit of each claimant herein I hold that the La Mantse has established his claim in title to the land in dispute as the owner thereof as against the stools of Teshie and Nungua. Judgment accordingly for the La Mantse with cost.�  In NARTEY VRS MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT LIMITED \[1987-88\] 2 GLR, it was also established that the land, subject matter of the dispute forms part of La Stool lands.  In all three cases with which the plaintiff supported his claim, Ogboja Lands did not form part of the subject matter of the disputes and the plaintiff�s reliance on them was misplaced.  On the issue of the conduct of the plaintiff�s predecessor, Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya, by which the trial court held that the plaintiff is estopped from laying claim to Ogbojo lands as La stool lands, this is what the court of Appeal said:  �Grounds 4 and 5 are in pari materia. This concern the issue of estoppel by the conduct of the predecessor of the plaintiff. The finding of the trial court on laches and acquiescence arise from the evidence of the defendant and co-defendant to the effect that Nii Anytei Kwakwaranya informed co-defendant that Ogbojo lands belong to the people of Ogbojo and therefore the co-defendant was sent to Ogbojo to acquire land from the defendant. It is our considered view that the way that piece of event was rendered turns customary law on its head. The custom known all over this country is that where a sub-chief or headman is in charge, the paramount chief would not personally or directly allocate land. The proper thing to do is to send the person looking for land to the person in charge who would act and �report� for consent and or concurrence - - -  Did the Court of Appeal find from the record especially the Deeds of conveyance and variation that the then La Chief, Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya gave his consent or concurrence for the alienation of the land to the co-defendants? Significantly, the La-Stool represented by the chief was not a party to the Deeds of conveyance and variation.  The co-defendants� evidence as given by the 1st co-defendant is clear on the issue as stated on p.149 of the record as follows�  �He told me he will consult the chief and elders of Ogbojo to see if they can help me - -  I went back to see him. He told me the chief and elders of Ogbojo have agreed to help me and grant me land. - - -  We went and saw the chief and elders of Ogbojo and informed them of the purpose of our visit which was to acquire land from them. They agreed to grant me land - - - From this evidence, did the chief of Ogbojo deal with the co-defendants as a caretaker chief? I do not think so and indeed subsequent events do not indicate that he dealt with them as such.  I agree with the trial Judge that the La-stool is estopped by Nii Anyetei Kwakwaranya�s conduct from laying claim of title to Ogbojo lands.  As the trial court held, even if Ogbojo lands are La-stool lands, it stood by and allowed the chief and elders of Ogbojo to deal with the lands as their owners.  The evidence is that they had enjoyed quiet an interrupted possession for well over 200 years. In recent times, exercised overt acts of ownership over the lands by the various grants of parts of the land to strangers without any reference to the La-stool. See exhibits �4�, 11, 11A-11F�.  Counsel for the Appellant took the court through what possession in Law means. In this regard he dealt with the various kinds of possession among which are actual, constructive and adverse which Black�s Law Dictionary defines as �the use and enjoyment of real property with a claim of right when that use or enjoyment is continuous, exclusive, hostile, open and notorious. In the instant case both the trial court and the court of Appeal agree that the Defendant made out a case of adverse possession. Where as the trial court limited the claim to the whole of Ogbojo lands, the Court of Appeal limited the claim to grants that fall within the limitation period. This is what the court per Douse J. A. said referring to section 10 of the Limitation Decree (N. R. C. D.) 54:  This section 10 (1) of the Limitation Decree provide:  �A person shall not bring an action to recover a land after the expiration of twelve years from the date on which the right of action accrued to the person bringing it or, if it first accrued to a person through whom the first mentioned claims to that person.  Some of Exhibits 4, 11, 11A to 11F were made as early as in 1978 and others as late as 1994. This suit commenced in 1994. Obviously some are caught by the Limitation.�  The chief of Ogbojo started dealing with Ogbojo lands as owner in possession when they started alienating parts of it. They continued until 1994 when the action was instituted. If the La Stool stood by and did not challenge the acts of the Ogbojo chief who was dealing with the land as owner, even if the lands did not belong to him and his people, then I agree with the trial Judge that the stool is caught by laches/acquiescence and is therefore estopped by conduct from laying any claim to the whole of, but not only some grants, Ogbojo lands.  Section 26 of the Evidence Decree provides that:  �Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule of equity when a party has, by his own statement, act or omission, intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, the truth of that thing shall be conclusively presumed against that party or his successor in interest in any proceedings between that party or his successors in interest and such relying person or his successor in interest.�  For the reasons herein assigned, I am of the view that the Appellant has succeeded in satisfying the court that the Judgment of the court below is indeed unreasonable having regard to the totality of the evidence on record. It is for this reason that I also allowed the appeal. The Judgment of the Court of Appeal regarding the Appellant is hereby set aside.  The co-Defendants who also claim to be dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal appealed against it on the grounds that :  �(i) Their Lordship erred when they set aside the trial Judge�s order striking out the appellants� from the suit on grounds that the pleadings did not disclose any cause of action against the appellants.�  �(ii) Their Lordships erred when they held that the trial Judge was in error when she held that the respondent was stopped by conduct from claiming that the Ogbojo lands belonged to the appellant�s granter, the Ogbojo Mantse.  �(iii) There was no evidence upon which their Lordships could find the appellants� documents of title were registered clandestinely.�  Of these three grounds, it is only ground (i) that needs consideration in view of the conclusion that I have arrived at with regard to the Defendant�s appeal.  On an application ex-parte by the plaintiff in the court below, the 1st and 2nd Co-Defendants were joined as parties to the suit by Apaloo J. (as he then was).  By another application, this time on notice, the third co-Defendant was also joined by the same judge.  The trial Judge, Dordzie J. in her Judgment upon submission of their counsel that joining the co-Defendants was a misjoinder because the plaintiff had not made any claims against them and the statement of claim does not disclose any cause of action against them, dismissed the action against them as according to her, she found them to be unnecessary parties to the suit.  She did this under Order 15 rule 6 (2) (a) of the High Court (civil Procedure) Amendment (NO. 2) Rules of 1977, L. I. 11229.  The said rule reads as follows:  �At any stage of the proceedings, the court may on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or an application order any person who has been improperly or unnecessarily made a party or who has for any reason ceased to be a proper or necessary party, to cease to be a party.�  The Court of Appeal found this wrong because the court was of the view that as third party beneficiaries they are necessary parties.  The court therefore re-instated the suit against them. It is this order of the court that they are dissatisfied with.  Who are these co-Defendants? The 1st and 3rd are corporate legal entities of which the 2nd co-Defendant is the Managing Director and chairman respectively. The 1st co-Defendant is the original lessee of the indenture tendered at the trial as Ex �1A� and the 3rd co-Defendant had to be made the lessee because their Bankers objected to the same company being the contractor and Developer. The 2nd co-Defendant was sued as Managing Director of the 1st co-Defendant in an Ex-parte application.  The record indicated that the co-Defendants had in their statement of Defence raised the issue of the joinder and asked that the action against them be dismissed.  A company has its own distinct legal identity. It can sue and be sued and is different from its members.  This court per Sophia Akuffo J.S.C. in the case of MORKOR VRS KUMA \[1998-99\] SCGLR held that:  �since the Appellant had been jointly sued with the 1st Defendant, a limited liability Company, for the only reason that she was the Chief Executive, main shareholder and a director of the company, she would be a proper party to the suit only if a specific personal liability were established against her or - - - - - -  In the instant case it is clear from the record that no act of misfeasance was established against the 2nd co-Defendant except that he is the Managing Director of the 1st co-Defendant. He was not a proper person to be sued and the trial court rightly dismissed the suit against him. The 1st and 3rd co-Defendant had been sued because according to the plaintiff they wrongly entered the land in dispute.  Even though the main issues before the court were between the plaintiff and the Defendant, the 1st and 3rd co-Defendants as grantees of the land stood to be affected by the final decision of the court and to that extent, the court of Appeal rightly re-instated them as parties to the suit.  For this reason, I affirm the decision of the Court of appeal in that regard.  R. C. OWUSU (MS)  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  DOTSE, JSC:  INTRODUCTION  I have had the advantage and privilege of knowing beforehand the detailed accounts of the judgment of my learned and distinguished brother, Atuguba JSC and I wish to say that I agree with the decision contained in the said judgment, which he has just read. That is to say that the appeal of the appellants succeeds, and that means the judgment of the Court of Appeal which reversed the decision of the High Court should be set aside in its entirety and is hereby set aside.  On my part, I regret to say that, having applied my mind to the best of my ability to the decision of the Court of Appeal, I am with respect unable to appreciate the ratio decidendi that informed their decision, and having regard to the undisputed facts which were established during the trial before the High Court, the decision of the High Court, is in my view unassailable and is in full accord with the evidence on record and in tune with sound principles of law.  Even though the facts of this case have been ably stated by the President of this Court, Atuguba JSC, let me on my own state the facts that will give some meaning and understanding to reasons I now give in support of the decisions I have reached that the appeal herein succeeds.  FACTS  On the 18th of January 1994, the Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent, (hereinafter known as the Plaintiff) who is the La Mantse issued a writ of summons and a statement of claim against the Defendant/Respondent/Appellant (hereinafter Defendant) and Co-Defendants/Respondents/Appellants.(hereinafter Co-Defendants).  The reliefs as endorsed on the writ read as follows:  After a series of amendments, Plaintiff�s case as made out in his amended statement of claim is seemingly a rather straightforward one.  According to him, Ogbojo village, the subject matter of the dispute is one of the villages under La Stool and forms part of La Stool Rural lands. The La Stool lays claim to these lands by reason of conquest many years ago.  Subjects of the La Stool settled on these lands but owed allegiance to the Stool, who has always been the allodial owner of these lands.  It is the Plaintiff�s case that these La rural villages which the citizens of La were allowed to found and occupy number about thirty-three (33), Ogbojo inclusive as is evidenced in the Gold Coast Civil Service List and other official publications. Reference Exhibit C on pg. 322 of the record.  Plaintiff further avers that there are copious number of judgments supporting the claim of the La Stool to the allodial ownership of all La Rural lands and cites a couple of them in support of his claim as C. Boi Owusu & Anor v Manche of Labadi 1 WACA 278 and In the matter of the Public Lands (Leasehold) Ordinance (Cap 138) and in the Matter of Land Acquired for the Service of the Colony and Ashanti situate at Mile Post 9 on the Accra-Dodowa Road for Presbyterian Secondary School: 1. The La Mantse 2. The Teshie Mantse and 3. The Nungua Mantse: Claimants.  The Plaintiff, in further support of his case states that the Head of any La Rural village may make grants of La Stool lands to subjects of La for subsistence farming only, or for the construction of dwelling houses only, but all other grants of land (e.g. made to strangers) can only be validly made with the prior approval of the La Mantse. This he claims is the custom in La. According to him, in recent times, the Defendant who is an Onukpa or Headman of the village of Ogbojo had been asserting a claim to Ogbojo lands as belonging to him and his family absolutely and refuses to recognise the allodial title of the La Stool to Ogbojo lands.  The Defendants case.  The Defendant strongly resisted the Plaintiff�s claims. The Defendant admitted they are subjects of the La Stool but principally subjects of Ogbojo. Ogbojo according to the Defendant consists of two families, namely the Anahor and Dzrase families, and further that, it was the Head and lawful representative of these composite families who had the absolute right to make grants of Ogbojo land for any purpose whatsoever. The Defendant further asserted that the La Stool had no proprietary title, right or interest whatsoever in Ogbojo village or Ogbojo lands.  The Defendant further averred that the Head and lawful representative of the families and their predecessors have consistently made absolute grants of Ogbojo lands without let or hindrance from any quarter and more importantly, without reference to the La Stool. In addition to this, the Head and his predecessors have also lawfully defended Ogbojo lands against several adverse claims without reference to the La Stool. The Defendant further pleaded that initially, when Top Construction Company Ltd made known its intention of acquiring land at Ogbojo, the Managing director approached the then La Mantse, Nii Anyetei Kwakwranya. The La Mantse informed the Managing Director to approach the Ogbojo Mantse because the Ogbojo people were the rightful people to alienate the land as it belonged to them. This alleged acknowledgement of the Chief of Ogbojo as the rightful owner of the disputed lands has been seized by Defendant as an estoppel by conduct against the Plaintiff.  In consequence of this representation, Defendant alleges that the MD redirected his request for land to the Ogbojo Mantse and was subsequently granted a lease for a term of twenty five (25) years.  According to the Defendant, the families of Anahor and Dzrase had been in peaceful uninterrupted possession of the land long before 1865, without let or hindrance from the La Stool and denied that the La Stool is entitled to its claims.  In the course of the suit, a series of applications were brought to join the first to third co-defendants. The co-defendants unsuccessfully resisted the application for joinder on the basis that they were not the proper parties, and further that the Plaintiff�s writ disclosed no cause of action against them.  Having been unsuccessful in resisting the order for joinder, the Co-Defendants were compelled to file appearance and enter a defence. Their defence was materially the same and they repeated that they had approached the then La Mantse, Nii Anyetei who sent them back to the Head of Ogbojo to make the alienation. They also pleaded estoppel against the Plaintiff and further pleaded that the case against them be dismissed as the Plaintiff did not make any claims against them. 2nd Co-Defendant also pleaded that he be struck out as a party as having no interest whatsoever in the suit.  At the close of pleadings, the learned trial Judge found the following issues relevant for determination of the case  For a resolution of the 2nd and 3rd issues as set down by the trial judge, she relied on the case of NARTEY V MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 314.  I will reproduce in extenso the analysis and conclusion of the trial judge in the resolution of the above-mentioned issues as set out at pages 261 and 262 of the record.  DECISION OF TRIAL COURT  �As regards the question whether a family can own any of the La rural lands, this is what the Supreme Court has to say per Taylor JSC at page 325  �I am not prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case that La rural lands belong to the La Stool. Both cases however did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own the land.�  The implication I gather from this is that irrespective of the decision in the C.B Owusu case, if the Dzrase and Anahor families of Ogbojo are able to prove their ownership of the Ogbojo lands effectively, this court can pronounce them owners of the land. What are the facts the defendant is grounding this claim on as against the claim of the Plaintiff?  These facts are as follows: a) their ancestor Okotse Adjah or Torgbortse Adjah found the land through hunting and searching for herbs.  b) Nii Okangfio later joined Okotse Adjah and together they established the Ogbojo village, the descendants of these two men have exercised acts of ownership over the Ogbojo lands over the years without any objection from the La Stool.  c) The Plaintiff�s predecessor Nii Anyetei Kwakranya, a former occupant of the La Stool acknowledged the Ogbojo people�s ownership of the land.  d) The La Mankralo in a ruling, exhibit 3 publicly declared the descendants of Okotse Adjah are (sic) the owners of the Ogbojo lands. Notice of the declaration dated 9th March 1990; exhibit 2 was served on the Plaintiff.  e) The grantees of the Ogbojo lands have had their documents registered for over 20 years without any objection from the La Stool.  On the part of the Plaintiff I have the following facts  a) Lands stretching from the foot of the Akwapim Hills to the present position of La at the Coast are La lands acquired by conquest. (The validity of this fact had been destabilized by i) DW 2�s evidence which was not challenged that part of the land lying below the foot of the Akwapim Hills belong to the people of Teshie.  ii) Exhibits 8 & 9 which show that Malejon and Manhia which are villages at the foot of the Akwapim hills and are described as La villages have some of their lands owned by Families.  b) Evidence adduced by the Plaintiff to specifically define the boundaries of the La Stool lands cannot be relied upon for reasons I have already given.  c) The Plaintiff predecessor acknowledged the fact that the Ogbojo lands are family lands and acted in respect of that fact without any objection from his elders.  The Defendant�s evidence before me is that their ancestors had occupied the land as their property long before 1865. The Plaintiff has not led any evidence to show that between that time and 1987, the La stool at any point in time demonstrated in any way that the disputed lands are not family land but stool land and that the La Stool took any steps to assert its title to the land.  When these set of facts are put on the scale, the facts supporting the Defendant�s assertion far outweigh that of the Plaintiff. I am inclined to believe that the Plaintiff is now putting up this claim of ownership of the Ogbojo lands because of the commercial value those lands have in recent times acquired.  With the evidence of the Defendant supported by the acknowledgement of the former occupant of the La Stool and the La Mankralo, coupled with Plaintiff�s own witness, PW2 Emmanuel Torgborfio Kwaku�s signatures on indentures executed by the chief and elders of Ogbojo admitting that they are the owners of the land, I have no cause to reject the fact that the Ogbojo lands are family lands belonging to the Anahor and Dzirase families of Ogbojo. I do hereby declare the land in dispute in this case described as Ogbojo lands the property of the Anahor and Dzrase families of Ogbojo. The property being family property the consent of the La Stool is not needed in making grants of the said land.�  Based on the above findings, the learned trial judge entered judgment for the Defendant and dismissed Plaintiff�s case. Earlier on in her judgment, the trial judge had dismissed the case against the co-defendant as having been unnecessarily joined to the suit. (See page 259-260 of the record)  Obviously aggrieved by the decision at the trial, Plaintiff filed an appeal in the court of appeal on the following grounds:  GROUNDS OF APPEAL  On the 17th of January 2008, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the trial court. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of the view that the Supreme Court nearly failed to provide a clear decision in the Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd case already referred to as to lead the lower courts. They therefore made a finding that the Ogbojo lands were La Rural lands belonging to the La Stool and accordingly declared title in the stool. The Court also reinstated the suit against the Co-Defendants, the reasoning being that they are third party beneficiaries of the wrongful alienation of La Stool lands and therefore stand to gain or lose at the end of the process.  APPEAL TO SUPREME COURT  As is to be expected, the losing parties in the Court of Appeal, being aggrieved appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Defendant filed the omnibus ground of appeal that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence on the record.  The Co- Defendants, listed three grounds of appeal as follows  i. Their Lordships erred when they set aside the trial judge�s order striking out the appellants from the suit on the grounds that the pleadings did not disclose any cause of action against the appellants.  ii. Their Lordships erred when they held that the trial judge was in error when she held that the respondent was estopped by conduct from claiming that the Ogbojo lands belonged to the appellant�s grantor, the Ogbojo Mantse.  iii. There was no evidence upon which their Lordships could find that the appellants documents of title were registered clandestinely.  I will proceed to deal first with the issues raised by the Co-Defendants grounds of appeal.  What are the circumstances which make it proper to join a party to an action? The test was laid out by the Supreme Court in the case of SAM (No. 1) v ATTORNEY-GENERAL \[2000\] SCGLR 102 where the majority of the Supreme Court (per Ampiah JSC Atuguba dissenting) held as follows:  �generally speaking, the court will make all such changes in respect of parties as may be necessary to enable an effectual adjudication to be made concerning all the matters in dispute. In other words, the court may add all persons whose presence before the court is necessary in order to enable it effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the cause or matter before it. The purpose of the joinder therefore is to enable all matters in controversy to be completely and effectually determined once and for all. But this would depend upon the issue before the court, i.e. the nature of the claim.�  Applying the facts in the instant case to the ratio above, what was the nature of the Plaintiff�s claim? The Plaintiff was asking for a declaration of title to all Ogbojo lands and an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant from disposing of Ogbojo lands or any part thereof without the approval and consent of the Plaintiff. From a reading of Plaintiff�s reliefs, it is difficult to appreciate how Co-Defendants addition to the suit will help in resolving the question of who has a better title to Ogbojo lands. It is clear that their presence will in no way facilitate the effectual determination of the matters in issue, and with due deference to their Lordships in the Court of appeal, they were wrong in overturning the decision of the trial court in dismissing the suit against the Co-Defendants.  Further, 2nd Co-Defendant protested that he had no interest at all in the suit and was not a proper party to the suit. It can be glimpsed from the record that the only reason for him being joined was as a result of his position as Managing Director of 1st and 3rd Co-Defendants. Indeed, it is a worn-out principle of law that a limited liability company is distinct from its members. See case of Salomon & Co v Salomon \[1897\] AC 22 H.L. This means that a company which has its own distinct legal identity, can sue and be sued, is different from persons employed by it. In the unanimous decision of this court in the case of Morkor v Kuma \[1998-99\] SCGLR 620, Sophia Akuffo JSC delivering the lead judgment stated as follows:  �Since the Appellant had been jointly sued with the 1st Defendant, a limited liability company, for the only reason that she was the chief executive, main shareholder and a director of the company, she would be a proper party to the suit only if a specific personal liability were established against her��  The fact of joinder in this instant case fits squarely into that of Morkor v Kuma supra and it is manifest that no claim of specific personal liability has been established against the 2nd Co-Defendant. In the interest of justice, the order of their Lordships in the Court of Appeal against the Co-Defendants generally would be reversed and the one made by the trial judge affirmed only to the effect that 2nd Co-Defendant be struck out as a party. This is because; it is only the distinct legal and corporate entities that will be maintained as parties to the suit. What must be noted is that, any decision in the matter one way or the other will affect the interests of the 1st and 3rd Co-Defendants as they stand to benefit from a judgment in favour of the Defendant who is their grantor. I will therefore maintain the 1st and 3rd Co-Defendants as parties in the case.  Having resolved the issue of joinder, I find it unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal filed by the Co-Defendants.  The Defendant�s sole ground of appeal was that the judgment was against the weight of evidence. This court has stated time without number that an appeal was by way of a rehearing. In Tuakwa v Bosom \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 61, Sophia Akuffo, JSC delivering the unanimous judgment of the court held thus:  �an appeal is by way of re-hearing, particularly where the Appellant alleges in his notice of appeal that the decision of the trial court is against the weight of the evidence� In such a case, it is incumbent upon an appellate court, in a civil case, to analyse the entire record of appeal, take into account the testimonies and all documentary evidence adduced at the trial before arriving at its decision, so as to satisfy itself that on a balance of probabilities, the conclusions of the trial judge are reasonably or amply supported by the evidence�.  In reviewing the entire record, I have set out earlier the findings of fact which informed the decision of the trial judge in arriving at her findings. Again, thanks to this court, the principle has been firmly laid on when an appellate court would be entitled to interfere with the findings of a lower court. I will cite some of these cases in support.  In Re Okine (decd); Dodoo & Anor. v Okine & Ors \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 582 laid down the principle as follows  �An appellate Court must not disturb findings of fact made by a trial Court, even if the appellate court would have come to a different conclusion, unless the findings of fact made by the trial judge were wholly unsupportable by the evidence. Therefore, where the evidence was conflicting, the decision of the trial court as to which version of the facts to accept was to be preferred, and the appellate court might substitute its own view only in the most glaring of cases. That was primarily because the trial judge had the advantage of listening to the entire evidence and watching the reactions and demeanour of the parties and their witnesses��  In Re Krobo Stool (No.1); Nyamekye (No.1) v Opoku \[2000\] SCGLR 347 basically re-echoes the point made above.  As per Atuguba JSC, � it is a worn-out principle of law that findings of fact made by a trial court are presumed to be right��  Akuffo JSC also made the point that �if the totality of the evidence on record sufficiently supports the conclusion�, it is not our function as an appellate Court to substitute our evaluation of the evidence in place of Nananom merely on the basis that, from our perspective, particular pieces of evidence ought to have been assigned more or less weight��  It was further held by Atuguba and Akuffo JJSC that since the parties had proffered conflicting traditional evidence in support of their respective claims, the law required that recent events supporting the claim of either party should sway the determination of the dispute. Thus the evidence of traditional history tested against recent events, relied upon by both the Kumasi Traditional Council and the National House of Chiefs in preferring the defendant�s version of the founding of the Krobo Stool was amply supported by the totality of the evidence on record�  The above dictum admits of no ambiguity in applying it to the present case. The trial judge had laid out the findings of fact as could be gleaned from the record and indeed gave reasons why she preferred the account of the Defendant to the Plaintiff. In fairness to the trial judge her conclusion was amply supported by the evidence on the record. With all due respect to their Lordships in the Court of Appeal, even if they disagreed with her conclusions, they were bound by the decisions supra of the Supreme Court and should have adverted their minds to it before over turning the decision of the learned trial judge, especially on the facts.  The Supreme Court speaking with one voice through Dotse JSC, in the unreported case of ASSEMBLIES OF GOD CHURCH, GHANA vs RANSFORD OBENG & ORS C.A. J4/7/2009, 3rd February, 2010 CORAM: Date-Bah JSC, Presiding, Adinyira, Owusu, Dotse and Anin-Yeboah JJSC reiterated the same principles of law on findings of fact by a trial court and referred to the following cases as well.  In the Assemblies of God v Ransford Obeng case referred to supra, Dotse JSC stated that, unless an appellate Court, such as this Court and the Court of Appeal for that matter, are satisfied that there are strong pieces of evidence on record which are manifestly clear that the findings of fact by the trial court are perverse and therefore unreliable, the appellate Court must be slow in interfering with the said findings of fact.  The rationale for this is based on the principle that it is the trial court that had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses that testified before it. The said court is therefore best placed in a position to make definite findings of fact, using the credibility and demeanour to assess the probative value of the said witnesses.  In the instant appeal, just as was held in the Assemblies of God case, I find no compelling reason to disturb the findings of fact so ably formed by the trial court and accordingly hold that the Court of Appeal was wrong to disturb those findings, and they are accordingly set aside.  Further, on the question of law, the issue of estoppel by conduct was raised and resolved by the trial judge, relying on the ratio in Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd supra. The judge held that even if Plaintiff succeeded in laying claim to the land, they were estopped by conduct from so doing. The Supreme Court had earlier on held in the Mechanical Lloyd case that the La Stool was estopped by conduct from asserting any claim to the land. Per Adade, Taylor and Wuaku JJ.S.C it was held that  �by the mandatory provisions of section 25 (1) of the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122) the registration of a deed of sale constituted actual notice of the fact of registration to the whole world. Consequently, on the assumption that the La Mantse was the true owner of Frafraha lands, he had intentionally for very many years and certainly since 28 September 1969 led the general public by his deliberate omission or failure to assert his ownership to believe that the Agbawe family of Frafraha were the owners of Frafraha lands. At any rate the stool had by its inaction permitted the general public including the appellant and even the government to believe that it had no objection to the conveyances made by the Agbawe family. In the circumstances the stool could not now assert any title against an innocent purchaser who had dealt with the Agbawe family following the La stool's inaction and acquiescence. Consequently, as against the appellant, the La stool were estopped by conduct from impugning the appellant's title which had been perfected by registration and his possessory acts.�  The facts which informed the above decision in the Nartey case are basically the same in the instant case. There is no evidence on the record that the La stool ever raised any objection to the alienation of the Ogbojo lands or had ever given its consent or made any grants on its own. If indeed it owned the lands, then the trial judge was right in making the finding that it had stood by and allowed the people of Ogbojo to believe that they indeed had absolute ownership of the land. The learned trial judge was therefore right in the observation made that the La Stool was making claims to the land because it had appreciated in value, and this was supported by the record and in holding that they were caught by the equitable doctrine of estoppel by conduct in applying the law to the facts as on the record. I am inclined to agree with Counsel for the Defendant that the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal took a very blas� view of the appeal especially on the law and in consequence came up with the wrong findings, not supported by the record.  This is what the Appeal Court had to say with regard to the issue of estoppel;  �Grounds 4 and 5 are in pari material. This concern the issue of estoppel by the conduct of the predecessor of the Plaintiff. The finding of the trial Court on laches and acquiescence arise from the evidence of the Defendant and Co-Defendant to the effect that Nii Anyetei Kwakranya informed Co-Defendant that Ogbojo lands belong to the people of Ogbojo and therefore the co-defendant was sent to Ogbojo to acquire land from the Defendant. It is our considered view that the way that piece of event was rendered turns customary law on its head. The custom known all over this country is that where a sub-chief or headman is in charge, the paramount chief would not personally or directly allocate land. The proper thing to do is to send the person looking for land to the person in charge and �report� for consent or concurrence��  With all due respect to the learned justices, this cannot be a true statement of the law. The Constitution, 1992 defines customary law to mean the rules of law, which by custom are applicable to particular communities in Ghana. Reference Article 11(3) . There cannot be a general application of customary law to all communities in Ghana as they vary from community to community. The conclusion reached by the judges in the Court of Appeal is too sweeping and general and not supported by the record. Accordingly, it cannot be allowed to stand.  The assertion by the Court of Appeal on the reception of the estoppel by conduct evidence in relation to the conduct of Nii Anyetei Kwakwranya, the predecessor of the respondent herein is full of flaws that there is the urgent need to correct that proposition of law.  1\. In the first place, there is this case of WIAPA & ANOR. v SOLOMON & ANOR \[1905\] Ren. 410 which established the principle that �ownership of land by a Head Stool necessarily implies ownership of it by sub-stools, quarters or families under the Head Stool and that the immediate control of lands is vested in the sub-stools, quarters or families.�  This principle of law has over the years been gradually transformed into situations where the sub-stools or families hold land in their own right by virtue of their long and undisturbed period of possession or by virtue of the different incidents of ownership as occurs in different parts of the country.  2\. Secondly, the Courts have taken judicial notice of the fact that Quarter lands exist not only in Osu and Labadi, but in Teshie as well. This therefore means that the Quarter lands are a distinct type of land ownership, unique and applicable to lands and communities in the eastern coastal Ga communities of Osu, La, Nungua and Teshie, See cases of T.A Osae & Ors vrs Numo Nortey Adjeifio & Ors \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 499, Akwei v Awuletey & Ors \[1960\] GLR 231 @ 236 S.C and  Nii Bonney III v Hammond & Ors 14 (WACA) 492.  These cases illustrate the existence of a unique system of land holding applicable to separate and distinct communities. This is then not a customary rule of practice which is of wide application throughout the country.  In the case of Seraphim v Amua-Sakyi \[1962\] 1 GLR 328, Ollenu J, (as he then was) stated the principle that a paramount stool cannot alienate land which has already been granted by the sub-stool, implying that the sub-stool might have alienated without reference to the paramount stool and therefore without its knowledge. Even though the Amua-Sakyi case supra was reversed on appeal, it was on grounds other than the customary law position stated by Ollenu J, and referred to supra. This customary law position was approved by Azu-Crabbe J.A (as he then was) in Odoi v Hammond \[1971\] 1 GLR 375. C.A.  The above cases are just a few referred to, to illustrate the fact that the case law position is exactly what the Constitution 1992, states in Article 11(3) that customary laws are the rules of law, which by custom are applicable to particular communities in Ghana. Thus for instance, in the Ewe speaking areas of the Volta Region, where Stool lands are basically non-existent, it will be a travesty of justice to apply the principle of customary law usage propounded by the Court of Appeal, since the Stools do not own land in those parts of the country.  Another compelling and good reason why the position stated by the Court of Appeal cannot be allowed to stand is the opinion stated by Adade JSC, which I agree with in the case of NARTEY V MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT \[1987-88\] 2GLR 314 holding (a) where he stated as follows:  �In our customary law the concept of ownership, particularly of land, is not the same as in other jurisdictions. For instance, ownership does not necessarily carry with it the right of exclusive control. And where land belonging to or attaching to a paramount stool is in the care and possession of a sub-stool, control often becomes a shared responsibility between the paramount stool and the sub-stool.�  For the above reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal with respect is flawed and it should not be allowed to stand. This is because basically, the Court of Appeal decision is at variance with the evidence on record in the trial court and secondly, had been based on wrong principles of law.  SCOPE OF THE DECISION IN THE CASE OF C. BOI OWUSU and A.A DSANE-Appellants vrs MANCHE OF LABADI-Respondent 1\[WACA\] 278, dated 15th May, 1933.  The undisputed facts in the above case are that, the appellants who are subjects of the La (badi) Stool proved that they and their ancestors had been in possession of the land acquired by Government for at least four generations and that their original ancestor found the land unoccupied. They therefore contended that the land had become their private property and unsuccessfully proved their acts of ownership.  The respondent on the other hand proved that the La people originally acquired a large area of land, including the area of land in question by conquest and that many subjects of the La Stool had settled on the land so acquired. The Court held on appeal that �long and uninterrupted user of land by subjects of Stool is not in itself sufficient to oust the title of the Stool�  In the case of NARTEY V MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT, the majority of the Supreme Court held as follows:  �The fact that the La Mantse was the proper authority to alienate or grant portions of La stool lands could not be disputed save that the general proposition was qualified.�  What then can be said to be the qualifications which will derogate from the basic principle so stated supra?  In the first place, the proposition of law is premised upon the fact that the land in dispute belongs to the La Stool or to the Head Stool. However, as in the instant case, where the trial court made definite findings of fact, based upon evidence that had been led before it, that, the Ogbojo Stool, and not the La Stool owned the allodial title, this fact is incontrovertible and is accepted as a correct finding of fact.  In the circumstances, the premise upon which the Owusu v Manche of Labadi case had been decided is inapplicable in the instant case and therefore cannot hold. For example, in the majority opinions of Adade and Taylor JJSC, they took pains to explain the inapplicability on a wholesale basis the principle of law in the Owusu case referred to supra. After reviewing the Owusu v Manche of Labadi case and a long line of cases including Baddoo v Ayorkor (1949) DC Lands 48-51, 149 @ 151, which seems to suggest that a sub-stool has no right to make grants to a stranger without the consent of the Head Stool, in contra distinction to Aryee v Adofoley (1951) 13 WACA, 161, which held that the Head Stool may not make any grants of such land without consulting the sub-stool, to cases like Akwei v Awuletey \[1960\] GLR 231 and applying those principles to the Nartey case, Adade JSC observed as follows:  �Applying these principles:  (a) The grant by the Frafraha Mantse to the plaintiff (exhibit B) with concurrence, be it constructive, of the Atofotse is valid.  (b) The grant by the La Mantse to R.A. Darko (exhibit R1/CA1) is invalid in so far as it purports to grant any portion of the land comprised in exhibit B, which to the knowledge of the La Mantse had already been given to the plaintiff by the caretaker sub-stool.  (c) In any case the grant exhibit R1/CA1 is invalid, as it was made without reference to the sub-stool of Frafraha.  All the above is on the footing that the land is La stool land and that the defendants can validly plead the title of R.A. Darko.�  From the above, it is clear that Adade JSC did not feel any inhibition to make the deductions he made irrespective of the decision in the Owusu case referred to supra. Clearly therefore, a sub-stool such as the Frafraha Stool, in an action where it had been established that the land is even La Stool land went further to hold that grants by the La Stool in respect of land already granted by the sub-stool to the Plaintiff would be declared invalid and were so held.  It is not surprising therefore that, Adade JSC continued with the following statement in the Nartey case. Ref page 343 of the report:  �Apart from the defendants' admissions, the La Mantse's claim to ownership is further weakened by the conduct of the La stool subsequent to the decision in Owusu (supra), as shown in the instant proceedings. Not only did the La stool fail to prove any acts of ownership over any of these lands, e.g. by grants made by it, or by calling the sub-stools to account to it, but which the La stool sought on one singular occasion to lay any claim to the land at Frafraha, the Agbawe family readily repelled the claim and caused their lawyer to issue a public notice (exhibit V) to the effect that the La stool has no land in Frafraha; the land belongs to the Agbawe family and all persons who want land should go to that family. The notice was public, and widely published in September 1967. It came to the notice of the La Mantse, and he simply recoiled into his shell, in all probability on the advice of his elders who knew better. In these proceedings he had every opportunity to explain his position in relation to the notice, but he did nothing, implying that he had none to offer. Following upon this notice the Frafraha Mantse continued to make grants to several people. So also did the Mantsemei of Adentan, Mpehoasem, etc all without reference to the La Mantse. It would seem to me that on the evidence the La Mantse's claim to own those lands is, to say the least, tenuous, Owusu (supra) notwithstanding.�  The death knell of the effect of the decision in Owusu appear to have been loudly sang in the words of Adade JSC which clearly asserted the rights of the sub-stools to make grants of the stool lands.  Taylor JSC of blessed memory, on his part went straight to the point and sought to limit the scope of the operation of the principle established by the West African Court of Appeal (WACA) in the Owusu case in 1933.  Per Taylor JSC:  �One very relevant fact which no doubt influenced and apparently dominated the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in this case, is part of proceedings in a 1932 suit which was tendered in evidence and in which the predecessor in title of the appellant's grantor, one Adjaye Komi, had clearly given evidence that Frafraha lands belonged to the La Stool. It would seem that this was evidence given in the case which ultimately went on appeal to the West African Court of Appeal and is reported as Owusu v. Manche of Labadi (1933) 1 W.A.C.A. 278� There is no doubt at all that in Owusu v Manche of Labadi (supra) were firm pronouncements made that Frafraha lands are La Stool lands.  In Hammond vrs Odoi \[1982-83\] GLR 1215, SC we dealt with approval, quite exhaustively with the holding in the Court of Appeal that Osu rural lands properly belonged to the Osu Stool. La and Osu are contiguous and would seem to have not too divergent customary practices, it is not therefore easy, nor am I prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case (supra) that La rural lands belong to the La stool. Both cases however, did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land and until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own a rural land, I confess quite frankly that I am not prepared, nor am I in a position to make a judicial pronouncement on the matter. That problem in my view does not arise in this appeal�  In view of the doubts operating on the mind of Taylor JSC in this Owusu case and its general application, Taylor JSC stated quite clearly that, in the interest of justice, and having regard to the Owusu case, and for the purpose of this case, only he was prepared to accept the evidence led by the La Manste that �the Mantsemei of Adentan, Oyarifa and Frafraha holds the lands in their respective villages as caretakers for the La Stool�.  With this caveat, and taking the antecedents of the instant case into consideration, is it not clearly established by the evidence led by the Mantse of Ogbojo in respect of the long period of uninterrupted usage, control and alienation of the lands in dispute without any reference to the La Stool had crystallised into rights of ownership which the La Stool can no longer contest and plead the Owusu case as an estoppel per rem judicatam?  It would appear therefore that, the Owusu case had been put into a scenario capable of different applications depending upon the circumstances of each case.  It was this window of hope and expansion that has been made in the Owusu case over the years that emboldened the learned trial judge not to apply it. In any case, as observed by both Adade and Taylor JJSC, it was not of general application.  As recent as 7th May 2008, the Supreme Court in the case of T. A. Osae and others vrs Numo Nortey Adjeifio and others (supra) held that the Otinshie family, represented by the plaintiffs therein, had absolute title to the area of land their ancestors had reduced into their possession, that is the building, farms lands and cemetery.  The decision of the Supreme Court was premised upon the fact that, the Otinshie village of the plaintiffs therein, a Teshie family was in existence and occupied by the plaintiffs family before the creation of quarter lands out of the Teshie stool lands.  In the T. A. Osae and others case, the Supreme Court identified 1927 as the year in which the Quarter lands were shared among the five Quarters of Teshie. That being the case, it presupposes that, the Otinshie family must have settled and occupied this Otinshie village, long before 1927.  Long and uninterrupted possession, occupation, coupled with the incidents of ownership and occupation together with the overt acts of ownership are crucial in any determination between rival claimants of allodial title especially as in the instant case, where one of the claimants is a Head Stool and the other a sub-stool.  My opinion on this matter is that, the Owusu case (supra) in view of recent developments in the case law of Ghana cannot be said to be of general application.  In any case, the appellant has in my view been able to lead satisfactory evidence that will convince any court that the La Stool did not have any rights of ownership which will divest the appellants of title.  Ogbojo lands, are certainly not La rural lands over which the La stool has ownership rights. The appeal succeeds on this ground as well.  CONCLUSION  From the analysis made supra, and on the totality of the evidence both on the facts and the law, it is clear that, the learned trial Judge came to the right conclusions based on the record of evidence led before her.  In the circumstances, the appeal herein succeeds and the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 17th day of January, 2008 is accordingly set aside together with all the orders made by them save the order re-instating the case in respect of the 1st and 3rd co-defendants.  In the result, the judgment of the learned trial High Court Judge, dated 17th day of February, 2004 is affirmed in its entirety that the Ogbojo lands are not La rural lands belonging to the La stool or the respondent herein, but belong to the Anahor and Dzrase families of Ogbojo who own these lands in dispute.  The only exception I wish to make is that, since from the record, the land in dispute was conveyed by the appellant to the 1st and 3rd Co-defendants/appellants herein, it goes without saying that as corporate entities capable of suing and being sued, the action is maintainable against them. This is because the purpose of Joinder of parties is to ensure that all necessary parties whose presence will help effectually determine all issues in controversy are necessary parties. Accordingly, I will strike out the 2nd co-defendant/appellant and state that his presence is not necessary in the case.  Save as stated above, the appeal filed by the appellant against the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 17/1/2008, succeeds and is accordingly set aside, whilst the judgment of the High Court, dated 17/2/2004 is affirmed.  J. V. M. DOTSE  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  BAFFOE-BONNIE, JSC:  I also agree that the appeal be allowed, the court of appeal be reversed and the judgment of the trial high court judge be reinstated.  Since the facts giving rise to this case have been ably recounted by my brother Dotse JSC, I will in large measure skip same unless it is for purposes of emphasis.  The substantive issue for determination in this case is very much settled and not in doubt at all. It is that �who is the allodial title owner of the Ogbojo lands in Accra?� Whist the plaintiff/appellant/respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff), claims allodial ownership of the said lands on behalf of the La Stool, by virtue of conquest, the defendant/respondent/appellant(defendant) claims allodial ownership on behalf the Anahor and Dzirase families of Ogbojo village, on account of first settlement of the place.  The evidence of their respective claims as established by evidence adduced at the trial, will be set out presently, but before then certain facts of no divergence were established at the trial.  1\. It was established at the trial that the first occupiers or settlers of the Ogbojo lands are the Anahor and Dzirase families.  2\. That the members of the Anahor and Dzirase families are originally from La.  In traditional customary law allodial title to land can be acquired through  1\. a long period of settlement of a vacant or an otherwise unoccupied lands or,  2\. conquest, through war, of the original occupiers of a land.  By their very nature, these two modes of acquisition of allodial ownership must predate the formation of nation states. It must also be noted that settlement on, or long occupation and user of, an otherwise vacant land by the subjects of a particular stool may or may not confer allodial ownership of the land in the stool whose subjects first settled on the land. Conversely the user of land by subjects, the allodial title of which is vested in a stool, no matter how long, does not divest the stool of such allodial title. Each case has to be treated on its merits.  These were the issues for determination in the case of Owusu v Manche of Labadi (1933)1 WACA 278.The facts of that case were that;  The appellant, who are subjects of the La(Labadi), proved that they and their ancestors had been in possession of the land acquired by Government for at least four generations, and that their ancestor who first took possession of the land found it unoccupied. On these grounds they contended that the land in question had become their private property. They also sought to prove certain acts of ownership on the part of their ancestors, but failed.  The respondent, on the other hand, proved that the Labadi people had originally acquired a large area of land including the land in question by conquest, and that many subjects of the Labadi stool had settled on the area so acquired. On these grounds he contended that the appellants were merely enjoying the use of stool land in accordance with native custom, and that their long and uninterrupted user had not ousted the original title of the stool.  Held, long and uninterrupted user of land by sujects of stool land is not, in itself, sufficient to oust the title of the stool�  In her judgment, the Learned Trial Judge had painstakingly sifted through the morass of evidence and set out the issues and undisputed facts. She said,  �Though the issues set down for trial in the summons for directions numbered about 20, the salient ones that stood out for determination at the close of evidence are set out in the address of plaintiff counsel and I will summarize them as follows:  1\. Whether Ogbojo lands are La stool lands acquired by conquest  2\. Whether or not grants of Ogbjo lands could only be made with the approval of the La Manche  3\. Whether the Plaintiffs are estopped from laying claims to Ogbojo lands  4/ Whether Ogbojo lands are owned by the Anahor Dzirase families and whether they had been in long uninterrupted possession without any let or hindrance from the La stool.  In the case of Nartey v. Mechanical Lloyd (1987-88)2 GLR 315 Justice Taylor said,  �I am not prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case that La rural land belong to la stool. Both cases however did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own the land�  Referring to this statement made by Taylor JSC and juxtaposing same with the reasoning behind the decision in the case of C.B. Owusu v. Manche(supra) (which had been copiously cited by both counsel, the learned trial judge set the tone for her judgment with this poignant statement,  �The implication I gather from this is that irrespective of the decision in the C.B. Owusu case, if the Dzirase and Anahor families of Ogbojo are able to prove their ownership of the Ogbojo lands effectively, this court can pronounce them owners of the land.�(emphasis added)  Summarising the evidence adduced before her the Learned Trial judge noted the following facts as grounding the claim of the parties. On the defendants she said  �a. their ancestor Okotse Adjah or Torgbotse Adjah found the land through hunting and searching for herbs  b. Nii Okangfio later joined Okotse Adjah and together they established the Ogbojo village, the descendants of these two men have exercised acts of ownership over the years without any objection from the La stool.  c. the plaintiff�s predecessor Nii Anyetei Kwakranya a former occupant of the La stool acknowledged the Ogbojo people�s ownership of the land.  d. the La Mankralo, in a ruling, exhibit 3, publicly declared the descendants of Okotse Adjah as the owners of the Ogbojo lands. Notice of this declaration dated 9th March 1990; exhibit 22 was served on the plaintiff .  e. the grantees of the Ogbojo Lands have had their documents registered for over 20 years without any objection from the La stool.  �On the part of the plaintiff, I have the following facts:  a. Lands stretching from the foot of the Akwapim hills to the present position of La at the coast are La Stool lands acquired by conquest . (The validity of this fact had been destabilized by  i. DW2�s evidence which was not challenged that part of the land lying below the foot of the Akwapim Hills belong to the people of Teshie.  ii. Exhibits 8&9 , which show that Malejon and Manhia which are villages at the foot of the Akwapim hills and are described as La villages have some of their lands, owned by families. )  b. Evidence adduced by the plaintiff to specifically define the boundaries of the La stool lands cannot be relied upon for reasons I have already given.  c. The plaintiff�s predecessor acknowledged the fact that the Ogbojo lands are family lands and acted in respect of that fact without any objection from his elders.  The defendant�s evidence before me is that their ancestors had occupied the land as to their property long before 1865. the plaintiff has not led any evidence to show that between that time and 1987 the La stool at any point in time demonstrated in any way that the disputed lands are not family land but stool land and that the La stool took any steps to assert its title to the land.  When these set of facts are put on scale, the facts supporting the defendant�s assertions far out weigh that of the plaintiff. I am inclined to believe that the plaintiff is now putting up this claim of ownership of the Ogbojo lands because of the commercial value those lands have in recent times acquired.  With the evidence of the defendant supported by the acknowledgements of the former occupant of the La stool and the La Mankralo, coupled with Plaintiff�s own witness PW2 Emmanuel Torgborfio Kwaku�s signatures on indentures executed by the the chief and elders of Ogbojo admitting that they are the owners of the land , I have no cause to reject the fact that the Ogbojo lands are family lands belonging to the Anahor and Drase families of Ogbojo . The property being family property the consent of the La Stool is not needed in making grants of the said land.� (emphasis added)  I dare say that the conclusion arrived at by the Learned Trial Judgse is very much in tune with the evidence before her. I believe that if the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal had exercised a little bit more care this decision would not have been disturbed. But they allowed themselves to be swayed unnecessarily by what they felt was the import of the C.B.Owusu case earlier referred to.  In the Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd case(supra) both Adade JSC and Taylor JSC commented on the limitations of the CB Owusu case. At pg 343 of the report ADADE JSC said,  � Apart from the defendant�s admission, the La Mantse�s claim to ownership is further weakened by the conduct of the La stool subsequent to the decision in Owusu( supra), as shown in the instant proceedings. Not only did the La stool fail to prove ownership over any of these lands, e.g. by grants made by it, or by calling the sub-stools to account to it , but when the La stool sought on one singular occasion to lay claim to the land at Frafraha, the Agbawe family readily repelled the claim and caused their lawyer to issue a public notice (exhibit V) to the effect that the stool has no land in Frafraha; the land belongs to the Agbawe family and all persons who want land should go to that family. The notice was public, and widely published in September1967. It came to the notice of the Mantse, and he simply recoiled into his shell, in all probability on the advice of his elders who knew better. In these proceeding she had every opportunity to explain his position in relation to the notice, but he did nothing, implying that he had none to offer. Following upon this notice the Frafraha Mantse continued to make grants to several people. So also did the Mantsemei of Adentan, Mpehuasem etc, all without reference to the La Mantse. It would seem to me that on the evidence the La Mantse�s claim to own those lands is to say the least, tenous, Owusu(supra) notwithstanding.�  Taylor JSC on his part expressed his doubts of the universal applicability of the Owusu case in the following words  �In Hammond v.Odoi 1982-83 GLR 1215 SC, we dealt, with approval , quite exhaustively, with the holding in the court of appeal that Osu rural lands properly belonged to the Osu stool. La and Osu are contiguous and would seem to have not too divergent customary practices. It is not therefore easy, nor am I prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case (supra), that La rural lands belong to the La Stool. Both cases however, did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land and until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own a rural land, I confess quite frankly that I am not prepared, nor am I in a position to make a judicial pronouncement on the matter. That problem in my view does not arise in this appeal.�(emphasis added)  That problem referred to by Taylor JSC arose in the recent case of T.A Osae and others v. Numo Nortey Adjeifio and others (unreported) suit no J4/22/2007 dated 7th May 2008  In that case the Otinshie family had laid claims to certain vast lands around Adjiringano. This was resisted by the Teshie stool. The Supreme Court, per Brobbey JSC, said that the Otinshie family had absolute title to the area of land that their ancestors had reduced into their possession, including their buildings farmlands and cemetery. The court came to this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the Otinshie family is actually a Teshie family. The court�s decision was premised on the fact of long and uninterrupted possession and occupation, plus the exercise of overt acts of ownership by the Otinshie family to the exclusion of the Teshie stool.  It is the same problem that the trial high court judge was confronted with in this case. Was the land owned by the Ogbojo people to the exclusion of the La stool or it was owned by the la stool with the Anahor and Dzirase families as mere caretakers?  At the High Court the traditional history led by the defendants as to how Ogbojo lands were acquired by their ancestors as far back the 19th century, was not challenged. The plaintiff on the other hand did not lead any evidence to show that between the 1860�s and 1987 the la stool at any point in time demonstrated in any way that the disputed lands are not family land but stool land and that the La stool took any steps to assert its title to the land in dispute.  In the case of Adjei-bi Kojo V Bonsie (1957) 3 WALR 257, it was stated that where in a land suit the evidence as to title to land is traditional and conflicting, the surest guide is to test such evidence in the light of recent acts to see which is preferable. Not only did the defendants fail to lead any traditional evidence, be it conflicting or confirmatory of that of the defendants, evidence of recent acts in relation to the land went against them. Evidence of recent acts established by the trial judge on record can be summarised as follows;  (i) The plaintiff�s predecessor Nii Anyetei Kwakranya, a former occupant of the La stool acknowledged the Ogbojo people�s ownership of the land when he personally directed the 2nd co-defendant to go and see the Ogbojo chief for land for his estate development.  (ii) The La Mankralo, in a ruling, exhibit 3, publicly declared the descendants of Okotse Adjah as the owners of the Ogbojo lands. Notice of this declaration dated 9th March 1990, exhibit 22 was served on the plaintiff.  (iii) Grantees of the Ogbojo Lands have had their documents registered for over 20 years without any objection from the La stool. Exhibits 4, 11,11a-11f are registered instruments made by Ogbojo chief and his elders of the land in dispute without seeking the consent of the la stool.  Quite frankly with this overwhelming evidence, traditional and recent, as well as documentary, the plaintiffs had a tall order convincing any court that, as against the Anahor and Dzirase families, the La stool had allodial title over Ogbojo lands. The trial High Court judge�s conclusion that the allodial titled was vested in Ogbojo people to the exclusion of the La Mantse is supported by evidence, is unassailable and I will not disturb same.  The issue of the wrongfulness or otherwise of the joinder of the co defendant to the action has been adequately dealt with by my brother Dotse, JSC and I support the conclusion he reached thereon.  To conclude therefore, I will allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the court of appeal and reinstate the decision of the Trial High Court on the substantive issue of who owns the allodial title to the Ogbojo lands.

"J U D G M E N T  GBADEGBE JSC:  In the action out of which this appeal arises, the plaintiff obtained judgment against the defendant for defamation and was awarded damages as well as an order directed at the defendant to publish a retraction of the publication on which the action turned. The defendant claiming to be aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial High Court appealed there from to the Court of Appeal. Pending the determination of the appeal, the defendant applied to the trial Court for an order of stay of execution of the orders of the Court. The application having been refused by the High Court, the defendant filed a repeat application that was authorized under the rules of the Court of Appeal. In its ruling dated 3rd March 2010, the Court of Appeal granted the application for stay of execution of the judgment of the High Court pending the determination of the appeal. The instant proceedings arise as a result of the appeal by the plaintiff from the order of stay of execution that was granted by the Court of Appeal.  In the notice of appeal on which these proceedings are based, the plaintiff raised several grounds of complaint against the delivery of the Court of Appeal. The delivery herein is sequential to the submission to the court by the parties of their respective statements of case. In considering the appeal herein, we propose to examine the grounds in the order in which they were argued in the plaintiff’s statement of case filed on 7th July 2010. This being the position, we commence with the ground that was formulated as follows:  “The court erred in granting an application that was manifestly incompetent.”  The above ground, in our opinion is expressed in vague or general terms contrary to the provisions of rule 6.5 of the Supreme Court rules, CI 16 which is in the following words.  “A ground of appeal which is vague or general in terms or does not disclose a reasonable ground of appeal is not permitted, except the general ground that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence and a ground of appeal or part of it which is not permitted under this rule, may be struck out by the Court on its own motion or on application by the respondent.”  This rule permits the court to strike out offending grounds of appeal but since we allowed the parties to address us on the said offending ground and in order not to deny the parties of the benefit of the submissions made there under, we would take it into account in the consideration of the appeal herein. It is hoped, however that this indulgence be not construed as a relaxation of the requirement of the rule on the content of grounds of appeal and that in the future the Court would apply the provisions of the rule strictly in order to achieve the purpose for which they were expressly made namely regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. In our opinion, it is not unreasonable to say that all persons who appear before this Court are of the expectation that the processes and steps that they take in any action or matter before the Court must, to be competent conform to the provisions of the Supreme Court Rules, CI 16.See: DAHABIEH v S A TURQUI \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 498.  In his arguments under the first ground, the plaintiff contended that since the application whose refusal is the subject-matter of this appeal was a repeat application under rule 28 0f the Court of Appeal Rules CI 19, the applicant ought to have provided in the affidavit supporting it that a previous application to the trial High Court had been made and refused. The plaintiff cited no authority to support his contention but suffice it to say that even if the said position were correct his conduct in swearing to an affidavit on the merits as well as exhibiting to his affidavit in answer to the application the ruling of the High Court on the application for stay have the effect of waiving what was a mere irregularity. Therefore, in our view this ground fails. See: Re MCRAE (1883), 25 Ch.D. 16  We then pass to a consideration of the next ground which was expressed thus:  “The Court of Appeal erred in interfering with the exercise of discretion by the trial High Court judge in the absence of any indication that the trial judge’s discretion was not judicially exercised.”  In support of this ground several cases were referred to on the principle that where a court below exercises a discretion on a matter before it, an appellate court should not substitute is own discretion for that of the court from which the appeal is mounted. A careful reading of the cases on which great reliance was placed by the plaintiff informs us that none of them deals with a repeat application but were pronouncements made in cases where the appellate courts were exercising the jurisdiction by way of an appeal from the exercise of discretion in a Court below. I think that although the application before the Court of Appeal involved the exercise of a discretion, to constrain the court in such matters to cases in which the jurisdiction to determine a discretionary matter is one primarily for the trial court which may only be reheard following an appeal lodged therefrom is to miss the difference between the two jurisdictions. While in one case the jurisdiction is primarily that of the trial court for example in an application for interlocutory injunction made to the trial court in the exercise of its jurisdiction and not consequent upon an appeal; in cases where an appellate Court exercises a repeat jurisdiction following a previous refusal by the trial court as for example in applications for stay of execution pending the determination of an appeal that is specifically provided for by the rules of Court the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the appellate court though is in relation to the same relief is independent and enables the appellate court to determine the matter with a view to doing justice to the parties. We make reference to rule 28 of the Court of Appeal Rules, CI 19 that provides as follows:  “ Subject to these Rules and to any other enactment, where under an enactment an application may be made to the Court below or to the Court, it shall be made in the first instance to the Court below, but if the Court below refuses to grant the application, the applicant is entitled to have the application determined by the Court.”  See: Twum JSC (as he then was) in the case of Ex-parte Ghana Cable Ltd \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 107 at 109.  We think that to reach any other conclusion on the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Appeal under rule 28 (supra) is to leave parties who lose their cases before trial Courts and whose application for stay of execution have been denied even wrongfully with no other remedy as in most cases such applications find no favor with the Court whose decision is on appeal. This, no doubt would undermine the integrity of the appellate process and render appeals not worth the while. We are of the opinion that no rational judicial system would give effect to the substance of the urgings on us by the plaintiff. Accordingly, this ground also fails. This leaves us with the next ground of appeal that was formulated thus:  “The ruling was against the weight of the affidavit evidence.”  The substance of the arguments submitted under this ground is that a consideration of the rival cases of the parties in terms of the affidavit evidence before the Court of Appeal did not warrant the grant of the application and that the application ought to have been dismissed. We have examined the record of appeal and attended to the very brief submissions made on this point and say without any hesitation that having regard to the orders made by the trial High Court particularly that of a retraction of the publication on which the action was planked, there was the need for the court to judiciously balance the respective rights of the parties in the matter pending the determination of the appeal, and it would have been unreasonable for the plaintiff to publish the retraction only to be adjudged successful on appeal. Then there is also the question of the refund of the judgment debt and costs that were awarded by the trial Court by the plaintiff in the event of the appeal succeeding. We think that the Court of Appeal must have taken these factors into consideration in allowing the application. In particular, we think that the learned justices of the Court of Appeal acted rightly in avoiding what might turn out to be an obvious embarrassment if the plaintiff were to publish the retraction ordered under the judgment only to be adjudged victorious on appeal. The effect is that this ground like those preceding it fails.  We now turn our attention to the fourth ground. The said ground was expressed as follows:  “ The court erred in basing itself on a material not before it and not being part of the evidence led and goading the Defendant\\ Respondent’s counsel on to claim a defence of qualified privilege which was not part of the defendant’s case at all.”  The argument on this ground was briefly expressed and it was this. That the defendant did not raise the defence of qualified privilege at the trial but was enabled to have it argued as part of his case at the hearing of the application for stay of execution before the Court of Appeal. In our thinking since the said assertion was challenged by the respondent in his statement of case in answer to the plaintiff’s submissions, the obligation was on the plaintiff to demonstrate that his version of the matter was true and in particular making available to the Court the relevant pleadings and the arguments made at the hearing of the application for stay of execution pending the determination of the appeal in the Court of Appeal. Not having sought the inclusion of the relevant documents in the record of appeal at the stage that the record was settled, his version of the record is not borne out by the record of appeal before us and taking into account section 37 of the Evidence Act (NRCD 323) on the presumption of regularity of official acts, this ground fractures and must fail. We now turn to the remaining ground, which is expressed in the following words:  “The defendant neither established that the appeal had a reasonable prospect of success nor that irreparable harm will be occasioned by the defendant by a refusal of the application”  We observe in regard to this ground that although an application for stay of execution pending appeal may be granted in the discretion of a Court when the judgment on which based is shown by the applicant at the hearing to suffer from an erroneous statement of law or that a refusal would occasion irreparable harm or inconvenience to the applicant these are not the only reasons for which a court may make a grant. The Court in granting or refusing an application for stay of execution pending the determination of an appeal acts according to well settled principles that enables it to bridge the gap in the intervening period between the delivery of the judgment in the court below and the time that the appeal is finally determined in order to deal with the rights of the parties in the pending appeal by the grant of interim or provisional remedies, which among others ensure that a successful appeal is not rendered nugatory by the making of orders such as that in respect of which the instant proceedings was launched by the plaintiff. We do not think that it is necessary for our decision in this application to embark upon the discussion of the reasons for which a Court may accede to an application for stay of execution. It is sufficient for the purpose of this decision to say that an examination of the ruling the subject-matter of these proceedings reveals that it was delivered taking into account settled principles in such cases and appears to us taking into account the processes on which the application was based that there were sufficient materials before them that justified their conclusion. Consequently, this ground of appeal also fails.  For these reasons, the appeal herein is dismissed and the ruling of the Court of Appeal dated 3 March 2010 is affirmed.  N. S.

"J U D G M E N T  DR. DATE-BAH JSC:  The key facts in this appeal are that a farming company (the plaintiff/respondent/respondent) entered into a loan agreement with a bank (the defendant/appellant/appellant) to finance the importation of 10 tractors from France. On their arrival in Ghana, the farming company took delivery and custody of the tractors. Dissatisfied with this, the bank seized the tractors and put them in its warehouse. It released 5 of the tractors to the company only after new terms had been agreed between them. The remaining five remained in the bank’s custody until they were ultimately sold by the bank. The bank claimed to be exercising rights under the original loan agreement that it had concluded with the farming company. But this agreement was never put in evidence at the trial. Eventually, the five tractors released to the company were also seized by the bank and sold.  The farming company brought this action in 1993, claiming:  a)“that an account be taken of the proceeds obtained by the Defendants from the operation of 5 (five) Renault agricultural tractors belonging to the Plaintiffs from 1988 to date of disposal plus interest on such proceeds at the rate of 26% or the prevailing bank rate whichever is higher;  b)that an account be taken of the proceeds obtained from the sale of 10 (ten) Renault tractors belonging to Plaintiffs by defendants plus interest thereon at 26% or the prevailing bank rate whichever is higher;  c)General damages for wrongful detention and disposal of 20 (sic) (ten) Renault tractors the property of the plaintiffs by the defendants or Alternatively an order for the replacement by the Defendants of the 10 Renault tractors plus damages for their wrongful detention and or wrongful disposal.  d)An order that any sums outstanding in respect of claims (a) and (b) above be paid to the Plaintiffs by the defendants.”  The bank, in response, counterclaimed for:  a)“Account of all the jobs undertaken by Plaintiffs and the proceeds obtained from them for the use of 5 (five) Renault Agricultural Tractors from 1986 to 1992.  b)Payment to defendants of the Plaintiff’s outstanding indebtedness and interest thereon at the current Bank rate.”  From the nature of the claim and counterclaim, it would appear that the company sued in tort, whilst the bank counterclaimed in contract. The claim and counterclaim of the company and the bank respectively came before Aryeetey JA, as he then was, for trial at the High Court and he delivered judgment on 30th July 2007 in favour of the company on its claim and dismissed the bank’s counterclaim, after a full trial.  The learned trial judge found that the bank, without reference to the farming company, had caused to be sold both the 5 tractors that they had permitted the company to put in use and the 5 brand new and unused tractors which they had refused to release to the plaintiffs. He also found that there was no justification for the bank’s detention of the company’s chattels. He found that the relationship between the bank and the company was that of banker and customer and nothing more. He highlighted the fact that the bank had been unable to produce a copy of the agreement under which it purported to exercise a right to take possession of the tractors. In his own words (at pp. 271-2 of the Record):  “However, what is missing from various documents tendered in evidence is what should have been the original loan agreement between the plaintiff company and defendant bank which in the first place facilitated the importation of the ten Renault tractors from France into the country. That document governed the relationship between the parties at the time of the seizure of the ten tractors which were warehoused at the instance of the plaintiff company. As it turned out by its conduct the defendant bank assumed the role of owners of all the ten tractors that were ordered at the instance of the plaintiff company and in fact were all consigned to the plaintiff company. I do not think that under the missing agreement document the defendant bank had power to seize the tractors on their arrival and assume the right as owners to compel the plaintiffs to agree to completely new terms under new agreements. If that had been the case the defendant bank would have been quick to tender that document in evidence in support of its despicable conduct in seizing the tractors from the plaintiffs.”  Although, as noted above, the company sued in tort, the learned trial judge purported to resolve aspects of the case on the basis of a contractual analysis. He was correct in this regard since the bank, having counterclaimed on its contract of loan for the farming company’s outstanding indebtedness to be enforced, put a contractual dimension of the case into play.  Aryeetey JA argued that since the bank was in fundamental breach of the contract of loan with the company by unlawfully seizing the tractors belonging to the company, this breach discharged the company from any further obligations under the contract of loan. Accordingly, the company was no longer under any obligation to repay the loan that it had received. This is a startling proposition of law and one that seems to invoke forfeiture as a penalty against the bank. Although it is in a different context that the maxim “equity abhors a forfeiture” is usually considered, issues of unconscionability and equity cannot be ignored on the facts of this case. The case has very significant commercial implications beyond the facts of this particular case and therefore deserves careful consideration, since the learned trial judge’s holding was in substance upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal.  The learned trial judge articulated the proposition of law referred to above thus (at pp. 279-80 of the Record):  “I am of the view that the breach in respect of the five tractors which the defendant bank kept and were not put to any use until they were sold at its instance together with the five other tractors which it had earlier released for use by the plaintiff company, without any reference to the plaintiff company, was fundamental in that the plaintiff company’s ownership of the tractors and its half measure means of repaying the loan were taken away. It also means that the conversion committed by the defendant bank in both instances which amounted to repudiation of its rights under the contract brought everything to an end and in fact by its conduct the defendant bank forfeited its rights to any further claims under the contract. It would not therefore be expected that the plaintiffs would be required to honour their debt obligation in respect of the ten tractors. On the other hand the plaintiff company would be entitled to pursue a claim for wrongful seizure and detention of their tractors. Indeed the plaintiffs claim for general damages for wrongful detention and disposal of all their ten Renault tractors by the defendants or alternatively an order for the replacement by the defendants of the ten Renault tractors plus damages for their wrongful detention and or wrongful disposal.”  This position of the learned trial judge would appear, on close analysis, to be awarding, in effect, double compensation in respect of the same injury arising from the same set of triggering facts. The company is released from the obligation to repay the debt it had contracted and received and also allowed to recover damages for conversion by the bank of the chattels purchased with the loan. Causes of action in both contract and tort are upheld on the same facts. Is this justifiable, on the facts of this case?  In principle, there can be concurrent liability in both contract and tort. In the past, there was some confusion on this issue of principle in English law, but the modern English law has been authoritatively settled in the English House of Lords case of Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd. \[1994\] 3 All E.R. 506. Lord Goff’s speech in that case is particularly instructive and it is helpful to quote a fairly lengthy passage from it on this issue (at p. 522 et seq.):  “All systems of law which recognise a law of contract and a law of tort (or delict) have to solve the problem of the possibility of concurrent claims arising from breach of duty under the two rubrics of the law. Although there are523variants, broadly speaking two possible solutions present themselves: either to insist that the claimant should pursue his remedy in contract alone, or to allow him to choose which remedy he prefers. As my noble and learned friend Lord Mustill and I have good reason to know (see J Bracconot et Cie v Cie des Messageries Maritimes (The Sindh) \[1975\] 1 Lloyd's Rep 372), France has adopted the former solution in its doctrine of non cumul, under which the concurrence of claims in contract and tort is outlawed (see Weir in XI Int Enc Comp Law, ch 12, paras 47-72, at para 52). The reasons given for this conclusion are (1) respect for the will of the legislator, and (2) respect for the will of the parties to the contract (see para 53). The former does not concern us; but the latter is of vital importance. It is however open to various interpretations. For such a policy does not necessarily require the total rejection of concurrence, but only so far as a concurrent remedy in tort is inconsistent with the terms of the contract. It comes therefore as no surprise to learn that the French doctrine is not followed in all civil law jurisdictions, and that concurrent remedies in tort and contract are permitted in other civil law countries, notably Germany (see para 58). I only pause to observe that it appears to be accepted that no perceptible harm has come to the German system from admitting concurrent claims. The situation in common law countries, including of course England, is exceptional, in that the common law grew up within a procedural framework uninfluenced by Roman law. The law was categorised by reference to the forms of action, and it was not until the abolition of the forms of action by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 that it became necessary to reclassify the law in substantive terms. The result was that common lawyers did at last segregate our law of obligations into contract and tort, though in so doing they relegated quasi-contractual claims to the status of an appendix to the law of contract, thereby postponing by a century or so the development of a law of restitution. Even then, there was no systematic reconsideration of the problem of concurrent claims in contract and tort. We can see the courts rather grappling with unpromising material drawn from the old cases in which liability in negligence derived largely from categories based upon the status of the defendant. In a sense, we must not be surprised; for no significant law faculties were established at our universities until the late nineteenth century, and so until then there was no academic opinion available to guide or stimulate the judges. Even so, it is a remarkable fact that there was little consideration of the problem of concurrent remedies in our academic literature until the second half of the twentieth century, though in recent years the subject has attracted considerable attention.  In the result, the courts in this country have until recently grappled with the problem very largely without the assistance of systematic academic study. At first, as is shown in particular by cases concerned with liability for solicitors' negligence, the courts adopted something very like the French solution, holding that a claim against a solicitor for negligence must be pursued in contract, and not in tort (see eg, Bean v Wade (1885) 2 TLR 157); and in Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194 this approach was firmly adopted. It has to be said, however, that decisions such as these, though based on prior authority, were supported by only a slender citation of cases, none of great weight; and the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine so adopted cannot be said to have been explored in any depth. Furthermore, when in Bagot v Stevens Scanlan & Co Ltd\[1964\] 3 All ER 577 at 580, \[1966\] 1 QB 197 at 204-205 Diplock LJ adopted a similar approach in the case of a claim against a firm of architects, he felt524compelled to recognise that a different conclusion might be reached in cases 'where the law in the old days recognised either something in the nature of a status like a public calling (such as common carrier, common innkeeper, or a bailor and bailee) or the status of master and servant'. To this list must be added cases concerned with claims against doctors and dentists. I must confess to finding it startling that, in the second half of the twentieth century, a problem of considerable practical importance should fall to be solved by reference to such an outmoded form of categorisation as this. I think it is desirable to stress at this stage that the question of concurrent liability is by no means only of academic significance. Practical issues, which can be of great importance to the parties, are at stake. Foremost among these is perhaps the question of limitation of actions. If concurrent liability in tort is not recognised, a claimant may find his claim barred at a time when he is unaware of its existence. … It can of course be argued that the principle established in respect of concurrent liability in contract and tort should not be tailored to mitigate the adventitious effects of rules of law such as these, and that one way of solving such problems would no doubt be 'to rephrase such incidental rules as have to remain in terms of the nature of the harm suffered rather than the nature of the liability asserted' (see Weir, XI Int Enc Comp Law ch 12, para 72). But this is perhaps crying for the moon; and with the law in its present form, practical considerations of this kind cannot sensibly be ignored.  Moreover I myself perceive at work in these decisions not only the influence of the dead hand of history, but also what I have elsewhere called the temptation of elegance. Mr Weir (XI Int Enc Comp Law ch 12, para 55) has extolled the French solution for its elegance; and we can discern the same impulse behind the much-quoted observation of Lord Scarman when delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd \[1985\] 2 All ER 947 at 957, \[1986\] AC 80 at 107:  'Their Lordships do not believe that there is anything to the advantage of the law's development in searching for a liability in tort where the parties are in a contractual relationship. This is particularly so in a commercial relationship. Though it is possible as a matter of legal semantics to conduct an analysis of the rights and duties inherent in some contractual relationships including that of banker and customer either as a matter of contract law when the question will be what, if any, terms are to be implied or as a matter of tort law when the task will be to identify a duty arising from the proximity and character of the relationship between the parties, 525their Lordships believe it to be correct in principle and necessary for the avoidance of confusion in the law to adhere to the contractual analysis: on principle because it is a relationship in which the parties have, subject to a few exceptions, the right to determine their obligations to each other, and for the avoidance of confusion because different consequences do follow according to whether liability arises from contract or tort, eg in the limitation of action.'  It is however right to stress, as did Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the present case, that the issue in Tai Hing was whether a tortious duty of care could be established which was more extensive than that which was provided for under the relevant contract. At all events, even before Tai Hing we can see the beginning of the redirection of the common law away from the contractual solution adopted in Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194, towards the recognition of concurrent remedies in contract and tort. First, and most important, in 1963 came the decision of your Lordships' House in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd \[1963\] 2 All ER 575, \[1964\] AC 465. I have already expressed the opinion that the fundamental importance of this case rests in the establishment of the principle upon which liability may arise in tortious negligence in respect of services (including advice) which are rendered for another, gratuitously or otherwise, but are negligently performed-viz, an assumption of responsibility coupled with reliance by the plaintiff which, in all the circumstances, makes it appropriate that a remedy in law should be available for such negligence. For immediate purposes, the relevance of the principle lies in the fact that, as a matter of logic, it is capable of application not only where the services are rendered gratuitously, but also where they are rendered under a contract. Furthermore we can see in the principle an acceptable basis for liability in negligence in cases which in the past have been seen to rest upon the now outmoded concept of status. In this context, it is of particular relevance to refer to the opinion expressed both implicitly by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest (with whom Lord Hodson agreed) and expressly by Lord Devlin that the principle applies to the relationship of solicitor and client, which is nearly always contractual (see \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 590-591, \[1964\] AC 465 at 497-499 where Lord Morris approved the reasoning of Chitty J in Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch D 39, and \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 610-611, \[1964\] AC 465 at 529 per Lord Devlin). The decision in Hedley Byrne, and the statement of general principle in that case, provided the opportunity to reconsider the question of concurrent liability in contract and tort afresh, untrammelled by the ancient learning based upon a classification of defendants in terms of status which drew distinctions difficult to accept in modern conditions. At first that opportunity was not taken.Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194 was followed by the Court of Appeal in Cook v S \[1967\] 1 All ER 299, \[1967\] 1 WLR 457, and again in Heywood v Wellers(a firm) \[1976\] 1 All ER 300, \[1976\] QB 446; though in the latter case (see \[1976\] 1 All ER 300 at 306, \[1976\] QB 446 at 459) Lord Denning MR was beginning to show signs of dissatisfaction with the contractual test accepted in Groom v Crocker-a dissatisfaction which crystallised into a change of heart in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801. That case was concerned with statements made by employees of Esso in the course of pre-contractual negotiations with Mr Mardon, the prospective tenant of a petrol station. The statements related to the potential throughput of the station. Mr526Mardon was persuaded by the statements to enter into the tenancy; but he suffered serious loss when the actual throughput proved to be much lower than had been predicted. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Mardon was entitled to recover damages from Esso, on the basis of either breach of warranty or (on this point affirming the decision of the judge below) negligent misrepresentation. In rejecting an argument that Esso's liability could only be contractual, Lord Denning MR dismissed Groom v Crocker as inconsistent with other decisions of high authority, viz Boorman v Brown (1842) 3 QB 511 at 525-526, 114 ER 603 at 608 per Tindal CJ; (1844) 11 Cl & Fin 1 at 44, 8 ER 1003 at 1018-1019 per Lord Campbell; Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd \[1957\] 1 All ER 125 at 139, \[1957\] AC 555 at 587 per Lord Radcliffe; Matthews v Kuwait Bechtel Corp \[1959\] 2 All ER 345, \[1959\] 2 QB 57 and Nocton v Lord Ashburton \[1914\] AC 932 at 956, \[1914-15\] All ER Rep 45 at 54 per Viscount Haldane LC. He then held that, in addition to its liability in contract, Esso was also liable in negligence. The other members of the Court of Appeal, Ormrod and Shaw LJJ, agreed that Mr Mardon was entitled to recover damages either for breach of warranty or for negligent misrepresentation, though neither expressed any view about the status of Groom v Crocker. It was however implicit in their decision that, as Lord Denning held, concurrent remedies were available to Mr Mardon in contract and tort. For present purposes, I do not find it necessary to comment on the authorities relied upon by Lord Denning as relieving him from the obligation to follow Groom v Crocker; though I feel driven to comment that the judgments in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon reveal no analysis in depth of the basis upon which concurrent liability rests. That case was, however, followed by the Court of Appeal in Batty v Metropolitan Property Realizations Ltd \[1978\] 2 All ER 445, \[1978\] QB 554, in which concurrent remedies in contract and tort were again allowed.  The requisite analysis is, however, to be found in the judgment of Oliver J in Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs & Kemp (a firm) \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384, in which he held that a solicitor could be liable to his client for negligence either in contract or in tort, with the effect that in the case before him it was open to the client to take advantage of the more favourable date of accrual of the cause of action for the purposes of limitation. In that case Oliver J was much concerned with the question whether it was open to him, as a judge of first instance, to depart from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Groom v Crocker. For that purpose, he carried out a most careful examination of the relevant authorities, both before and after Groom v Crocker, and concluded that he was free to depart from the decision in that case, which he elected to do. It is impossible for me to do justice to the reasoning of Oliver J, for which I wish to express my respectful admiration, without unduly prolonging what is inevitably a very long opinion. I shall therefore confine myself to extracting certain salient features. First, from his study of the cases before Groom v Crocker, he found no unanimity of view that the solicitor's liability was regarded as exclusively contractual. …  He expressed his conclusion concerning the impact of Hedley Byrne on the case before him in the following words (\[1978\] 3 All ER 571 at 595-596, \[1979\] Ch 384 at 417):  'The case of a layman consulting a solicitor for advice seems to me to be as typical a case as one could find of the sort of relationship in which the duty of care described in the Hedley Byrne case \[1963\] 2 All ER 575, \[1964\] AC 465 exists; and if I am free to do so in the instant case, I would, therefore, hold that the relationship of solicitor and client gave rise to a duty on the defendants under the general law to exercise that care and skill upon which they must have known perfectly well that their client relied. To put it another way, their common law duty was not to injure their client by failing to do that which they had undertaken to do and which, at their invitation, he relied on them to do. That duty was broken, but no cause of action in tort arose until the damage occurred; and none did until 17th August 1967. I would regard it as wholly immaterial that their duty arose because they accepted a retainer which entitled them, if they chose to do so, to send a bill to their client.'  I wish to express my respectful agreement with these passages in Oliver J's judgment. Thereafter, Oliver J proceeded to consider the authorities since Hedley Byrne, in which he found, notably in statements of the law by members of the Appellate Committee in Arenson v Arenson \[1975\] 3 All ER 901, \[1977\] AC 405 and in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801, the authority which relieved him of his duty to follow Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194. But I wish to add that, in the course of considering the later authorities, he rejected the idea that there is some general principle of law that a plaintiff who has claims against a defendant for breach of duty both in contract and in tort is bound to rely upon his contractual rights alone. He said (\[1978\] 3 All ER 571 at 598, \[1979\] Ch 384 at 420):  'There is not and never has been any rule of law that a person having alternative claims must frame his action in one or the other. If I have a contract with my dentist to extract a tooth, I am not thereby precluded from suing him in tort if he negligently shatters my jaw (Edwards v Mallan \[1908\] 1 KB 1002).'  The origin of concurrent remedies in this type of case may lie in history; but in a modern context the point is a telling one. Indeed it is consistent with the decision in Donoghue v Stevenson itself, and the rejection in that case of the view, powerfully expressed in the speech of Lord Buckmaster (see \[1932\] AC 562 esp at 577-578, \[1932\] All ER Rep 1 esp at 10), that the manufacturer or repairer of an article owes no duty of care apart from that implied from contract or imposed by statute. That there might be co-existent remedies for negligence in contract and in tort was expressly recognised by Lord Macmillan in Donoghue v Stevenson \[1932\] AC 562 at 610, \[1932\] All ER Rep 1 at 25 and by Lord Wright in Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd \[1936\] AC 85 at 102-104, \[1935\] All ER Rep 209 at 216-217. Attempts have been made to explain how doctors and dentists may be concurrently liable in tort while other professional men may not be so liable, on529the basis that the former cause physical damage whereas the latter cause pure economic loss (see the discussion by Christine French 'The Contract/Tort Dilemma' (1981-84) 5 Otago LR 236 at 280-281). But this explanation is not acceptable, if only because some professional men, such as architects, may also be responsible for physical damage. As a matter of principle, it is difficult to see why concurrent remedies in tort and contract, if available against the medical profession, should not also be available against members of other professions, whatever form the relevant damage may take.The judgment of Oliver J in Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs & Kemp (a firm) \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384 provided the first analysis in depth of the question of concurrent liability in tort and contract. Following upon Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801, it also broke the mould, in the sense that it undermined the view which was becoming settled that, where there is an alternative liability in tort, the claimant must pursue his remedy in contract alone. The development of the case law in other common law countries is very striking. In the same year as the Midland Bank Trust case, the Irish Supreme Court held that solicitors owed to their clients concurrent duties in contract and tort: see Finlay v Murtagh \[1979\] IR 249. Next, in Central Trust Co v Rafuse (1986) 31 DLR (4th) 481 Le Dain J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, conducted a comprehensive and most impressive survey of the relevant English and Canadian authorities on the liability of solicitors to their clients for negligence, in contract and in tort, in the course of which he paid a generous tribute to the analysis of Oliver J in the Midland Bank Trust case. His conclusions are set out in a series of propositions (at 521-522); but his general conclusion was to the same effect as that reached by Oliver J. He said (at 522):  'A concurrent or alternative liability in tort will not be admitted if its effect would be to permit the plaintiff to circumvent or escape a contractual exclusion or limitation of liability for the act or omission that would constitute the tort. Subject to this qualification, where concurrent liability in tort and contract exists the plaintiff has the right to assert the cause of action that appears to be the most advantageous to him in respect of any particular legal consequence.'  I respectfully agree.  Meanwhile in New Zealand the Court of Appeal had appeared at first, in McLaren Maycroft & Co v Fletcher Development Co Ltd\[1973\] 2 NZLR 100, to require that, in cases where there are concurrent duties in contract and tort, the claimant must pursue his remedy in contract alone. There followed a period of some uncertainty, in which differing approaches were adopted by courts of first instance. In 1983 Miss Christine French published her article on the contract/tort dilemma in (1981-84) 5 Otago LR 236, in which she examined the whole problem in great depth, with special reference to the situation in New Zealand, having regard to the 'rule' in McLaren Maycroft. Her article, to which I wish to pay tribute, was of course published before the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Central Trust case. Even so, she reached a conclusion which, on balance, favoured a freedom for the claimant to choose between concurrent remedies in contract and tort. Thereafter in Rowlands v Collow \[1992\] 1 NZLR 178 Thomas J, founding himself principally on the Central Trust case and on Miss French's article, concluded that he was free to depart from the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in McLaren Maycroft and to hold that a person530performing professional services (in the case before him an engineer) may be sued for negligence by his client either in contract or in tort. He said (190):  'The issue is now virtually incontestable; a person who has performed professional services may be held liable concurrently in contract and in negligence, unless the terms of the contract preclude the tortious liability.'  In Australia, too, judicial opinion appears to be moving in the same direction, though not without dissent: see, in particular, Aluminum Products(Qld) Pty Ltd v Hill \[1981\] Qd R 33 (a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland) and Macpherson & Kelley v Kevin J Prunty & Associates \[1983\] 1 VR 573 (a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria). A different view has however been expressed by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 585, to which I will return later. In principle, concurrent remedies appear to have been accepted for some time in the United States (see Prosser Handbook on the Law of Torts (7th edn, 1984) p 444), though with some variation as to the application of the principle in particular cases. In these circumstances it comes as no surprise that Professor Fleming, writing in 1992, should state that 'the last ten years have seen a decisive return to the ""concurrent"" approach' (see Fleming Law of Torts (8th edn, 1992) p 187).  I have dealt with the matter at some length because, before your Lordships, Mr Temple QC for the managing agents boldly challenged the decision of Oliver J in the Midland Bank Trust case \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384, seeking to persuade your Lordships that this House should now hold that case to have been wrongly decided. This argument was apparently not advanced below, presumably because Oliver J's analysis had received a measure of approval in the Court of Appeal: see eg Forster v Outred & Co (a firm) \[1982\] 2 All ER 753 at 764, \[1982\] 1 WLR 86 at 99 per Dunn LJ. Certainly there has been no sign of disapproval, even where the Midland Bank Trust case has been distinguished: see Bell v Peter Browne & Co (a firm) \[1990\] 3 All ER 124, \[1990\] 2 QB 495. Mr Temple adopted as part of his argument the reasoning of Mr J M Kaye in an article The Liability of Solicitors in Tort (1984) 100 LQR 680. In his article Mr Kaye strongly criticised the reasoning of Oliver J both on historical grounds and with regard to his interpretation of the speeches in Hedley Byrne. However, powerful though Mr Kaye's article is, I am not persuaded by it to treat the Midland Bank Trust case as wrongly decided. First, so far as the historical approach is concerned, this is no longer of direct relevance in a case such as the present, having regard to the development of the general principle in Hedley Byrne. No doubt it is correct that, in the nineteenth century, liability in tort depended upon the category of persons into which the defendant fell, with the result that in those days it did not necessarily follow that, because (for example) a surgeon owed an independent duty of care to his patient in tort irrespective of contract, other professional men were under a similar duty. Even so, as Mr Boswood QC for the names stressed, if the existence of a contract between a surgeon and his patient did not preclude the existence of a tortious duty to the patient in negligence, there is no reason in principle why a tortious duty should not co-exist with a contractual duty in the case of the broad duty of care now recognised following the generalisation of the tort of negligence in the twentieth century. So far as Hedley Byrne itself is concerned, Mr Kaye reads the speeches as restricting the principle of assumption of responsibility there established to cases where there is no contract; indeed, on this he tolerates no dissent, stating (p 706) 531that 'unless one reads \[Hedley Byrne\] with deliberate intent to find obscure or ambiguous passages' it will not bear the interpretation favoured by Oliver J. I must confess however that, having studied yet again the speeches in Hedley Byrne in the light of Mr Kaye's critique, I remain of the opinion that Oliver J's reading of them is justified. It is, I suspect, a matter of the angle of vision with which they are read. For here, I consider, Oliver J was influenced not only by what he read in the speeches themselves, notably the passage from Lord Devlin's speech quoted above (see \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 610-611, \[1964\] AC 465 at 528-529), but also by the internal logic reflected in that passage, which led inexorably to the conclusion which he drew. Mr Kaye's approach involves regarding the law of tort as supplementary to the law of contract, ie as providing for a tortious liability in cases where there is no contract. Yet the law of tort is the general law, out of which the parties can, if they wish, contract; and, as Oliver J demonstrated, the same assumption of responsibility may, and frequently does, occur in a contractual context. Approached as a matter of principle, therefore, it is right to attribute to that assumption of responsibility, together with its concomitant reliance, a tortious liability, and then to inquire whether or not that liability is excluded by the contract because the latter is inconsistent with it. This is the reasoning which Oliver J, as I understand it, found implicit, where not explicit, in the speeches in Hedley Byrne. With his conclusion I respectfully agree. But even if I am wrong in this, I am of the opinion that this House should now, if necessary, develop the principle of assumption of responsibility as stated in Hedley Byrne to its logical conclusion so as to make it clear that a tortious duty of care may arise not only in cases where the relevant services are rendered gratuitously, but also where they are rendered under a contract. This indeed is the view expressed by Lord Keith of Kinkel in Murphy v Brentwood DC \[1990\] 2 All ER 908 at 919, \[1991\] 1 AC 398 at 466, in a speech with which all the other members of the Appellate Committee agreed.”  Even though this extended passage from Lord Goff’s speech shows that there can be concurrent liability in contract and tort, the facts of each case will determine whether the extent of any concurrent imposition of a liability in contract and tort is justifiable.  Aryeetey JA, the learned trial judge, justified his decision to release the company from its debt obligation by reference to the law on the discharge of contracts by breach. The learned trial judge relied on the proposition of law enunciated by the Court of Appeal in In re Timber and Transport Kumasi – Krusevac Co. Ltd, Sativa v Bonsu \[1981\] GLR 256 that where a contract party manifests a clear intention to be no longer bound by the terms of the contract or where he openly repudiates it, the innocent party might treat it as at an end and seek such remedies as are open to him or her. In that case, the Court of Appeal said:  “The crucial issue which in our view was avoided by the High Court is whether the agreement was still binding on the parties. On this issue, we are thrown back on first principles and particularly on the effect of breaches of an agreement by one or other of the parties. The principle which emerges from a long line of decisions is that where one party manifests a clear intention to be no longer bound by the terms of his contract or where he openly repudiates it, the innocent party may treat the contract as at an end and seek such remedies as are open to him. Where the breach hits at the root or substance of the contract, in other words, where the breach is fundamental, the innocent party may accept the breach and treat it as absolving him from his own obligations under the contract. The question whether a breach is fundamental is, of course, for the court to determine: see Wallis, Son & Wells v. Pratt and Haynes \[1910\] 2 K.B. 1003, C.A.; Sweet & Maxwell Ltd. v. Universal News Services Ltd. \[1964\] 3 All E.R. 30 and Joseph v. Boakye \[1977\] 2 G.L.R. 392 at p. 402, C.A.”  Whilst this statement of the law is largely correct, it needs further clarification in the context of the facts of this case. In this connection, I would like to refer to the analysis of Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract (15th Ed, 2007) on the effect of discharge by breach, at p. 691:  “A party who treats a contract as discharged is often said torescind the contract. To describe the legal position in such a manner, however, must inevitably mislead and confuse the unwary. In its primary and more correct sense, as we have already seen, rescission means the retrospective cancellation of a contract ab initio, as for instance where one of the parties has been guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation. In such a case the contract is destroyed as if it had never existed, but its discharge by breach never impinges upon rights and obligations that have already matured. It would be better therefore in this context to talk of termination ordischarge rather than ofrescission.”  This analysis is illuminating and I accept it. It is supported by the House of Lords decision in Johnson v Agnew \[1980\] AC 367, where Lord Wilberforce said (at pp. 392-3):  “it is important to dissipate a fertile source of confusion and to make clear that although sometimes the vendor is referred to …as ‘rescinding’ the contract, this so-called ‘rescission’ is quite different from rescission ab initio, such as may arise for example, in cases of mistake, fraud or lack of consent. In those cases the contract is treated in law as never having come into existence… In the case of an accepted repudiatory breach the contract has come into existence but has been put an end to, or discharged. Whatever contrary indications may be disinterred from old authorities, it is now quite clear, under the general law of contract, that acceptance of a repudiatory breach does not bring about ‘rescission ab initio’.""  The implication of this analysis for this case is that the obligations of the company that arose before the date of the conduct by the bank held by the learned trial judge to be in breach of contract are not wiped out but remain binding. The company is released from any further performance of the discharged contract, from the date of discharge, but its accrued obligations remain binding. It cannot therefore be correct to hold that it is relieved from the obligation to repay the loan it contracted and which it had received in full. As at the date of discharge of its contract of loan, the company’s debt obligation (that is, the obligation to repay the loan) had already accrued. The debt was accordingly not discharged. The company is limited to recovering damages in contract for the breach found by the learned trial judge, which breach was supported by evidence on the record. This recovery of damages would be governed by the usual contract law principles laid down in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch. 341 as to remoteness of damage. Beyond remoteness and as to the measure of the damages payable to the company, this again would be governed by the usual principle of restitutio in integrum. The company must be restored, so far as money can do it, to the position that it would have been in, had the breach not occurred. This is where the concurrent recovery of damages in tort for the same conduct characterized as breach of contract becomes relevant. If the recovery of damages in tort has already secured for the company a restitutio in integrum, it follows that only nominal damages can be awarded it for the breach identified by the learned trial judge.  The learned trial judge’s error in holding that the company was absolved from any obligation under the contract of loan is perpetuated in a different guise by the Court of Appeal and is thus the subject of grounds of appeal before this Court. Grounds (ii) and (iii), which were argued together, are as follows:  ii.“The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law when they held that after the consolidation of the debt the Plaintiff/Respondent ceased to be liable for the payment of the debt.  iii.The learned Justices misdirected themselves in law on the nature and effect of consolidation of debts which misdirection led them to hold that after consolidation the debt ceased to be payable.”  Quaye JA, in delivering the Court of Appeal’s judgment, had said, in relation to the bank’s counterclaim for the payment of the company’s outstanding indebtedness to it, (at p.426 of the Record) that:  “The second segment of the counterclaim was in respect of respondent’s outstanding debt. Learned Counsel shot himself in the foot when he contended that the various loans that the respondents contracted with the appellants were consolidated at a point in time. This is a correct statement upon the facts and evidence before us. The loans which were consolidated upon the suggestion, advise (sic) or prompting of the appellants were FF 1.958.180.00 for the ten tractors and c707.500.00 other loan. In order to resolve whether the appellants were entitled to the Court’s decision on this segment of the counterclaim to warrant the setting aside of the finding by the trial Court, it is my candid view that we determine the legal meaning and effect of consolidation….”  The learned judge then proceeds to define consolidation and then continues:  “The point which I want to bring home is that merging, or fusion or consolidation of two loan accounts had the effect of each of them losing its previous separate identity and from the time of consolidation, they become one. Take for example, pouring water from two different containers into one container. After that, you cannot identify which was previously contained in one or other of the two containers….  The total effect therefore is that only one loan account stood in the records of the appellants for the obligation of the respondents after the accounts had been consolidated. In Law, it is not available for the appellants to turn round after the merger at their own prompting, to want to see two separate loan accounts. The law would neither allow a party to take advantage of his own wrong nor to approbate and reprobate at the same time….It is therefore clear that, as at the time this action was commenced, and more specifically, at the time the counterclaim was made, there was only one loan account between the appellants and the respondents, irrespective of how the loan was contracted, the purpose(s) for which segments thereof were given and taken or the time it was done. There was no separate debt standing against the respondent. If there was, then the appellants failed to lead evidence to establish that fact. I can identify no error in the refusal by the learned trial judge to grant the counterclaim and the reasons supporting his refusal. This ground of appeal fails and it is dismissed.”  With respect, the learned Justice of Appeal is in error in his view that the company had no debt liability at the time the counterclaim was filed. Apart from the bank’s objection to the issue of consolidation being a ground of decision when it had not been argued in the appeal, on which I will give my view later in this judgment, the learned Justice seems to make the assumption that the only debt in respect of which there could be liability was the “other loan” of c707,500. That seems to be the explanation for the great lengths to which he went to establish the consolidation of the two loans. He seemingly fails to appreciate that the receipt of FF 1.958.180.00 to finance the importation of the ten tractors also resulted in a debt. The counterclaim was thus with reference to both amounts. There is undisputed evidence on record that the bank supplied the funds for purchase of the tractors.  In my view, as already set out above, the holding by the learned trial judge that the breach of contract by the bank discharged the company from its accrued obligation to repay the loan it had already received was clearly erroneous. That view equally applies to the holding by the Court of Appeal on this point. The extent of the award of both a tort and a contract remedy, on the facts of this case, leads to overkill in the remedying of the plaintiff’s injury. I would therefore allow the appeal on grounds (ii) and (iii) and give judgment in favour of the appellant on item (b) of its counterclaim, namely, there should be “payment to the defendants of the Plaintiff’s outstanding indebtedness and interest thereon” at the Bank rate. This payment is, however, to be made subject to the payment by the appellant of the damages awarded by the learned trial judge in favour of the plaintiff/respondent/respondent in respect of the tort of conversion committed by the appellant/appellant/defendant. The payment of the plaintiff’s indebtedness is also to be made subject to whatever damages is awarded by this court in respect of the breach by the defendant of the loan agreement.  The plaintiff/respondent/respondent, however, disputes this result, in its Statement of Case, and makes the case that the defendant/appellant/appellant had failed to prove its counterclaim and therefore it should be dismissed. This is how it puts its case in its Statement of Case:  “As noted earlier in these Submissions, in the case of Claim (ii)(i.e. the second segment of the counterclaim), the Appellants mentioned no specific sum in their Counterclaim. However, two sums were mentioned in the course of the evidence of their Representative as the indebtedness for which they were counterclaiming. On the 27 May 1997, he stated the figure as c 367,624,305.68 (vide p. 99 of the Record, line 19). Then on 4/7/97, he put the figure at c412,679,178.74 (vide p. 105 of the Record, line 9). In both cases, the figure was said to be the outstanding sum as at 30/8/96.  A Counterclaim is a fresh action. It is joined to another suit so as to avoid a proliferation of suits. The same standards of proof apply to a counterclaim and a normal suit. The party making a counterclaim must prove the claim. Where the claim is for a liquidated sum, it must be strictly proved. This the Appellants woefully failed to do. In the absence of proof which of the sums mentioned by the Representative, and noted above, is the Judge to accept. In any event, it is submitted that the claim was not properly before the Court because of the Appellant’s failure to specify the amount in their pleadings and to pay the appropriate filing fee thereon (vide p. 149 of the Record) where the Representatives of the Appellants failed to say the Appellants paid a filing fee for this claim.  In the circumstances the only decision that can be made fairly on the counterclaim is to dismiss them.”  Thus the respondent company, by this argument, tries to move the issue of its liability on the appellant’s counterclaim from one of contract law, as discussed above, to one of evidence and civil procedure. At this level also, I do not think that it can escape liability. There was indisputable evidence on record of its acceptance of a loan from the bank to finance the importation of the tractors. Its endeavour to quibble at the exact amount of the outstanding debt cannot rescue it from liability. The exact amount of the indebtedness was ascertainable from evidence on record. Admitted facts do not need to be proved and the fact that respondent owed money to the appellant was not disputed by the respondent. In the respondent’s own Statement of Claim, he averred in paragraphs 12 to 16 as follows:  12.“Defendants granted the Plaintiffs a loan of FF 1,284,780 with interest pegged at 26% per annum. A loan agreement dated 23 June 1988 was signed between Plaintiffs and Defendants.  13.The Plaintiffs through their Managing Director secured the total loan now amounting to FF 1,958,180 including the sum of FF 673,400.91 earlier granted by the Defendants with three residential houses situated in Tamale the title deeds of which were lodged with the Defendants.  14.The Defendants also unilaterally decided to add the sum of c707,500.00 being an unrelated loan granted to the Plaintiffs in 1986 to the loan for the purchase of the tractors.  15.The Defendants charged a processing and commitment fee of c9,317,020.30 to cover the loan made to the plaintiffs.  16.In due course, the Plaintiffs took delivery of the 10 Tractors and informed the Defendants.”  By these averments, it is clear that, by the plaintiff/respondent/respondent’s own pleadings, it admitted the existence of a loan from the appellant. It is thus estopped by representation from denying the existence of the loan in its defence to the counterclaim of the appellant in the same proceedings. The appellant indeed did admit, in its Statement of Defence, para. 12 of the respondent’s Statement of Claim. The loan agreement of 23 June 1988 was thus an admitted fact. In spite of this, the respondent generally traversed, in its Defence to the Counterclaim, all the averments in the Counterclaim of the appellant, which in part relied on this loan agreement and the other loan of c707,500 which existed in the appellant’s books. The respondent was thus approbating and reprobating.  Beyond the pleadings, there was testimony at the trial, which established the respondent’s liability on the loans that were the basis for the Counterclaim of outstanding indebtedness. In the evidence in chief of the respondent’s representative, Mr. Abdu Aziz, he made the following admission (at p. 72 of the Record) when asked:  “Q. Has your company paid any part of the loan to the bank.  A.No.”  Also, there was testimony by the Appellant’s representative, in his evidence-in-chief to the following effect (at p. 99 of the Record):  “It is normal practice for the bank to open a loan account for all our borrowing customers. It is expected that loan repayments for the customers are paid into this account. In the particular case of Hajaara Farms Limited payments into this account Number 76 were mainly by transfers from the two operational account –that is Number 9211. No payments on withdrawal in respect of the loan account are made by cashiers. I have in my hand the loan account Number 76 of the plaintiffs. I would like to tender it in evidence – no objection – admitted and markedExhibit 11. Exhibit 11 indicates that there were only a few repayments into the account. As a result of loan repayment Hajaara Farms as at the statement date on 30/8/96 still owed the bank an amount of c367,624,304.68. Payment for this amount is long overdue.”  The respondent, in its Statement of Case, points out that there was testimony given by the same witness in which he stated a different amount as the debt owing as at 30/8/96. At p. 105 of the Record, the Defendant’s representative said:  “The plaintiff company is owing the bank. As at 30/8/96 the company owed the bank c412,679,178.74. Judgment should be given to the defendants for that amount with interest. It is due for payment.”  This unfortunate internal conflict and contradiction in the evidence of the same witness cannot be interpreted as absolving the plaintiff/respondent/respondent from liability on its admitted loan transaction with the appellant bank. It would be perverse and against the weight of evidence to do so. I would rather resolve the conflict by holding the company liable for the lesser sum, namely, c367,624,304.68 as at 30/8/96, together with interest at the bank rate. In spite of the extensive cross-examination of the witness, he was not shaken in his testimony that there was an outstanding indebtedness of the respondent to the appellant.  I am not impressed by the respondent’s captious point about the appellant’s failure to pay a filing fee for its counterclaim. The respondent contends that this is a basis for a dismissal of the counterclaim. The testimony relied on to found this point is inconclusive. The defendant/appellant/appellant’s representative was asked (at p. 149 of the Record):  “Q. Do you know how much filing fees was paid for your counter-claim  A. I don’t know.”  This testimony cannot be the basis for dismissing the counterclaim.  The arguments rehearsed above apply, mutatis mutandis, to grounds (iv) and (v) of the Appellant before this court, which it argued together. These are:  iv.“The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law when they failed to distinguish between the loan contract and the tort of detinue and conversion which failure led to the erroneous decision that the loan (admitted by the Plaintiff/Respondent) ceased to be payable.  v.The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law by avoiding the issue of whether or not the tort of detinue and conversion allegedly committed by the Defendant/Appellant amounted to a repudiation of the loan contract which issue was the main basis upon which the trial court rejected Defendant/Appellant’s Counterclaim for the payment of the debt.”  In support of these grounds, the bank argued as follows in its Statement of Case (Para. 20):  “One of the grounds on which the High Court dismissed the Appellant’s counterclaim for the outstanding debt (see pages 279 – 280 of the Record quoted above) was that by “seizing” the tractors, the Appellant repudiated the loan agreement under which the Bank wholly financed the importation of the 10 tractors. At pages 406-407 of the Record the Appellant strongly argued at the Court of Appeal that the learned High Court judge failed to distinguish between the loan agreement through which the Bank provided 100% funding for the importation of the ten tractors and the subsequent alleged tort of detinue and conversion committed. The Appellant further argued that if the High Court had drawn the distinction between the two it would have seen its way clear in upholding the legitimacy of the counterclaim for the outstanding debt especially after awarding the Respondent damages for the detinue and conversion. Equity fairness and justice require that the Respondent’s indebtedness should at least have been set off against the damages awarded him in order not to unjustly enrich the Respondent.”  It is clear from my earlier discussion and holding in this judgment that I accept the main thrust of the bank’s argument on this point, namely, that its counterclaim should be upheld and that the seizing of the tractors, even if a breach of contract, did not release the company from its obligation to repay the debt. I would, in consequence, uphold ground (iv) of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. Ground (v), however, causes me some discomfort and I would not uphold it in the exact language through which it is expressed. Admittedly, the learned Justices of Appeal were in error in not addressing the issue of whether the bank’s conduct in seizing the tractors constituted a breach of contract and what were the consequences of that breach of contract. However, their error was not in failing to address the issue of whether “the tort of detinue and conversion allegedly committed by the Defendant/Appellant amounted to a repudiation of the loan contract”, as alleged in the ground of appeal. The learned trial judge had held the defendant bank liable in both contract and tort and it would have been right for the learned Justices of Appeal to have adverted to the issue of whether the bank’s conduct had indeed been a breach of the contract of loan.  However, I do not accept the argument made by the bank in support of this ground of appeal to the effect that the High Court’s decision that there was a fundamental breach of the loan agreement was an error of law. I uphold the High Court’s decision that there was a fundamental breach of the loan agreement. My disagreement with that Court relates to the consequences of that fundamental breach, and not to the breach itself. To my mind, the consequence of the fundamental breach was the bank’s liability to pay damages and not the cancellation of the debt obligation owed to it by the plaintiff/respondent/respondent. This is an implication of the law explained above that discharge by breach does not relate back to set aside obligations that had accrued before the date of discharge. However, the damages payable, on the facts of this case, might only be nominal, because of the substantial damages awarded by the learned trial judge in respect of the tort liability of the appellant bank, unless there is evidence that the plaintiff has proven a loss not covered by the tort damages. Restitutio in integrum is the purpose of the award of contract damages and not unjust enrichment of the innocent party beyond restoring him or her to the position he or she would have been in if the breach had not taken place. Accordingly, in place of the learned trial judge’s cancellation of the plaintiff company’s debt obligation to the defendant bank, I would substitute nominal damages payable by the bank to the plaintiff/respondent/respondent company for the breach of the loan agreement, unless the Record discloses that the Plaintiff has proven substantial damages beyond the loss covered by the tort damages.  Ground (vi) of the Appellant bank’s grounds of appeal reads as follows:  “The learned Justices of Appeal erred by upholding the damages awarded by the trial Court in spite of the legal submissions made by the Defendant/Appellant and further by failing to properly take into account the outstanding debt admitted by the Plaintiff/Respondent from which the importation of the ten (10) tractors was financed.”  The Appellant supports this ground with only one paragraph in its Statement of Case. That paragraph states:  “Our main grievance on the above ground is the fact that the High Court after awarding such damages should have taken into consideration the outstanding debt owed by the Respondent and set it off against the damages so as not to unjustly enrich the Respondent because after all it was the Appellant that wholly paid for the ten tractors for the Respondent and yet ask him not to pay the loan is most unfair, unjust and unconscionable. The Court of Appeal therefore committed an error when it affirmed the High Court’s erroneous decision.”  Apart from complaining about the High Court’s failure to take the plaintiff/respondent’s outstanding debt liability to the defendant/appellant into account, this ground of appeal does not appear to complain about the quantum and principles underlying the damages awarded by the High Court in tort. If it does, it is half-hearted. The issue of the outstanding debt has already been dealt with above. Subject to that, I would affirm the damages awarded by the learned trial judge. In explaining how he quantified the damages payable in respect of the conversion, he said (at pp. 281-2 of the Record):  “For the moment I would deal with the assessment of damages in respect of the five tractors which the defendant bank refused to release for the use of the plaintiff company. A practical way of assessing the minimum value of the five tractors which were not put to use and remained in the custody of the defendant bank until they were disposed of would be to estimate what amount it cost the plaintiff company to procure all five of them. I think the total indebtedness of the plaintiffs to the bank which emanated from the loan transaction between the bank and the plaintiffs should be a safe guide in arriving at what it least cost the plaintiff to procure the tractors. According to the evidence on record the purchase and importation of the ten tractors were wholly funded by monies provided by the bank. Therefore it would be reasonable in the circumstances to limit the minimum value to be placed on the ten tractors to the total indebtedness of the plaintiff company to the defendant bank. According to exhibit 13 quoted above the plaintiff company, at the inception owed the defendant bank amounts of FF 1,958180.00 and �776470.00 which represent the total amount it cost the plaintiff company to procure the ten Renault tractors. It means therefore that the value of five of the Renault tractors would be half of the two amounts, which would be FF979,090.00 and c388.235.00 respectively. To me the total of the two amounts would be adequate compensation for the plaintiffs in the nature of damages for the conversion committed by the defendant bank in respect of the five tractors which it refused to release to the plaintiff company after their unjustifiable and unwarranted seizure.”  In relation to the remaining five tractors which were released to the plaintiffs, the learned trial judge explained his quantification of damages in relation to them as follows (at p. 284 of the Record):  “…they were entitled to the award of damages for conversion which would be equal to the value of the five tractors at the time of their sale. Unlike the five tractors which were not released, it would not be relatively easy to compute their value at the time of sale, especially when no evidence was led by the plaintiff company in that regard. That, of course, is understandable since the plaintiffs’ pleading did not anticipate that the court would treat the five tractors which were not released differently from the other five. To be on a safe side we just have to limit our assessment of the value of the five tractors, which were used for some time, to the total amount which was derived from their sale at the instance of the defendant company.”  An issue which arises from the learned trial judge’s quantification of the tort damages is whether after the award of those damages, there is any room left for the award of further damages, whether in contract or in tort. In tort, an argument could be made in support of consequential loss of profit by the plaintiff company caused by the commission of the tort. The difficulty for the plaintiff is that such consequential loss of profit has to be proved. Moreover, the plaintiff did not cross-appeal against the quantum of tort damages awarded it.  Alternatively, the plaintiff could rely on contract to recover further damages flowing from the fact that the bank’s unlawful seizure of the plaintiff’s chattels, in breach of contract, probably caused it to lose profit. The first problem for a court seeking to award supplementary contract damages on this score is that the plaintiff did not sue in contract. However, the defendant bank did counter-claim in contract. Thus, in determining whether the plaintiff’s liability under the loan contract to the defendant bank remains outstanding, the issue can be legitimately addressed as to whether any loss, beyond that in relation to which tort compensation had already been awarded, had been caused to the plaintiff by the defendant’s breach of the contract of loan such that that loss should be deducted from the plaintiff’s indebtedness to the defendant bank. In principle, it is reasonable to hold that the plaintiff’s indebtedness under the contract of loan should be reduced by the monetary value of any breaches of that contract by the defendant bank. In this regard, the main loss raised by the evidence on record relates to the plaintiff’s probable loss of profits from the use of the five tractors that were never released to them, in consequence of the defendant bank’s breach of contract. Can this be quantified and how is it to be quantified?  Because the plaintiff did not sue in contract, it did not lead evidence of any loss of profits from being denied the use of the five tractors that were not released to it. That makes the task of quantifying loss of profit difficult. The failure to lead evidence on loss of profits also raises the issue of whether this court is precluded from awarding substantial damages in respect of the defendant bank’s breach of the contract of loan.  The English Court of Appeal case of Sunley and Company Ltd. v Cunard White Star Ltd. \[1940\] 1 KB 740 provides ideas as to how this Court might deal with the absence of evidence on the loss of profit. That case also dealt with how to measure damages for a breach of contract resulting in loss of use of a chattel, in that particular case for a week. The plaintiffs had not led any evidence on loss of profit resulting from this loss of use. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs were entitled to such damages as would put them pecuniarily in the same position as if the week’s delay had not taken place. The court awarded modest sums in respect of depreciation of the machines that had been delayed, for interest, maintenance and wages. The Court said (at p. 747 of the Report):  “In these circumstances, the plaintiffs really failed to prove any facts on which their damages could be estimated. In the absence of evidence they relied on the law. And the learned judge unfortunately succumbed to the invitation to discuss a variety of cases likeThe Mediana \[1900\] A.c. 113 at great length. Those cases establish that when a plaintiff is deprived of the use of a chattel which he does not use for making profit he is not to be debarred from claiming as damages what during that time its use would have been worth to him, had he not been prevented from using it. But those cases are no authority for the proposition that, if the owner of a profit-earning chattel does not prove the loss he has sustained, the judge may make a guess in the dark and award him some arbitrary sum.”  The court, therefore, set aside the trial judge’s award of 250 pounds as damages for the plaintiffs’ loss of use of their machinery because of the defendants’ delivery of the machinery a week late in breach of contract. The court, however, did go on to award damages under the following principles (at p. 748):  “The machine here was a chattel of commercial value, but on the facts before us there are only four possible heads of damage: (1) depreciation which was running on, (2) interest on the money invested which was being wasted, (3) some trivial amount of maintenance which was no doubt involved, (4) some expenditure of wages which were thrown away.”  The total amount of damages awarded by the court under these heads was in total 14 pounds. This case illustrates that, in the absence of evidence of loss of profits, a court may assess some damages under the four heads mentioned above, but those damages should be modest, though more than nominal.  Applying the approach of Sunley v Cunard White Star Ltd. (supra) to the facts of this case, I would be inclined to deduct from the plaintiff’s indebtedness to the defendant bank the interest that was due to be paid, from the date of seizure of the tractors to the date of their sale, on the debt payable. I do not consider that the other possible heads of damage are relevant, on the facts of this case.  The Appellant bank abandoned ground (vii) of its grounds and therefore it will not be dealt with here. That leaves only ground (i) as the ground not yet dealt with in this judgment. Ground (i) reads as follows:  “The learned Justices of Appeal erred by suo motu raising and basing their decision on the legal effect of consolidation of the loan without giving the parties an opportunity to be heard on the issue.”  In arguing this ground in its Statement of Case, the appellant/appellant/defendant, whilst admitting that in appropriate cases the Court of Appeal could raise an issue not canvassed by any of the parties to determine an issue before it, urged that the power should be exercised with great circumspection and pointed out that the authorities made it clear that the parties should be given a reasonable opportunity to react or comment on an issue raised suo motu by the Court. The Appellant relied on the well-known case of Dam v Addo \[1962\] 2 GLR 200 to sustain its argument. In that case, Adumua-Bossman JSC, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, said (at p. 203):  “The process of consideration and weighing up of the respective cases of the parties by which the learned judge arrived at the conclusion at which he did arrive, would appear to have involved the substitution by him proprio motu of a case substantially different from, and inconsistent with, the case put forward by the respondents and the ultimate acceptance by him of that substituted case which was not the respondents’ case at all. This acceptance in favour of a party of a case different from and inconsistent with that which he himself has put forward in and by his pleadings, has been consistently held to be unjustifiable and fundamentally wrong both by the English superior courts and our local superior courts.”  The issue is whether this principle is relevant to the facts of this case. Whilst, undoubtedly Quaye JA discussed the legal issue of the consolidation of the loans disclosed by the evidence in this case, it would not appear that the legal issue raised in it was inconsistent with the case put forward by the plaintiff company in the High Court, as my discussion earlier in this case has shown. He did not rely on any new facts or on a case incompatible with the plaintiff’s case that it was not liable on the counterclaim. Whilst it is desirable and prudent for an appellate court to invite arguments on propositions of law it intends to rely on other than those canvassed by the parties before it, there is no absolute bar on an appellate court from deciding a case on the basis of such a proposition of law. In any case, what occasioned the miscarriage of justice, through the application of the proposition of law relating to the consolidation of the loans, in this case was its perpetuation of the learned trial judge’s error in refusing to enforce the plaintiff company’s admitted indebtedness, rather than the lack of notice of the legal gloss in the argument adopted by Quaye JA. I would accordingly dismiss this ground of appeal.  In the result, the appeal is allowed in part. The damages for conversion awarded by the learned trial judge and affirmed by the Court of Appeal are hereby further affirmed, subject to a deduction from them of the plaintiff/respondent/respondent’s outstanding indebtedness to the defendant/appellant/appellant, which stood at c367,624,304.68 as at 30/8/96, together with interest at the bank rate, in accordance with the Court (Award of Interest and Post Judgment Interest) Rules, 2005 (CI 52). However, there should be deducted from the interest thus payable the interest due on the sum owed to the defendant from the date of seizure of the tractors to the date of their sale. This deduction of interest represents a measure of damages for breach of the contract of loan which is more than nominal damages. Of course, the post-judgment interest rate applicable under CI 52 will equally apply to the damages awarded by the High Court for conversion.  (SGD) DR. S. K. DATE BAH  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  ATUGUBA J.S.C:  Certain matters on which I would have liked to express an opinion have not been raised by the parties and the evidence relating to them does not appear to be incontrovertible. I therefore, on the facts of this case, agree with the learned, comprehensive and masterly analytical judgment of my able brother Dr. Date-Bah, JSC.  (SGD) W. A. ATUGUBA  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  ANSAH JSC.  I had the benefit of reading before hand the didactic and eclectic judgment of my noble and respected brother, Date Bah JSC. I agree with his analysis of the facts giving rise to this suit. I also agree he has carefully and fairly dealt with the un-treaded issue of concurrent causes of action in tort and contract in our jurisdiction; I agree with his conclusion that the appeal before us be dismissed in part.  With the above, there would not be any need for me to say anything more except perhaps only to add some few words in further support.  I shall limit myself to the issue of contact obligations as far as loans are concerned just to lend further support to what has been said already.  The case of Barclays Bank Ghana Ltd v Sakari 1997-98 1 GLR 746, SC, is worthy of mention. The facts of the case as reported in the head-notes are that:  “The plaintiff-bank granted an application by the defendant a customer for a loan of �2,145,420 to enable him purchase two Mercedes Benz trucks hr required for the operation of his business. However, without the consent of the plaintiff, the defendant used the loan to purchase a Saurer tanker instead of the Mercedes Benz trucks. A week after the purchase of the tanker, it was seized by the government on the ground that Saurer trucks were to be operated exclusively by the State and not individuals. After repeated unsuccessful demands by the plaintiff on the defendant to repay the loan, the plaintiff brought an action against him at the High Court, Tamale, for, inter alia, recovery of the loan plus the accrued interest thereon. In his defence, the defendant contended that the unexpected seizure of the Saurer tanker by the government had frustrated the loan agreement and had thereby discharged him his obligations under the contract. The trial High Court found that it was a term of the loan agreement that the defendant was to operate the Saurer tanker and repay the loan from its proceeds. It therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s claims on the ground that the loan transaction had been frustrated by the seizure of the Saurer tanker by the government. On appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed by a two to one majority decision. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court against the majority decision of the Court of Appeal.”  The Supreme Court allowed the appeal. While the court held that the events leading to the seizure of the vehicles did not amount to frustration it nonetheless addressed the issue of the supposed frustration of the contract vis-�-vis the obligations to the parties under the contract, Acquah JSC as he then was held thus:  “Now what is the obligation created under this loan contract, a breach of which would entitle the other to sue? The obligation of the bank was to advance the money which it did and that of the defendant was to repay the loan together with interest if any. This is the obligation of the parties under this loan contract, and indeed almost all loan contracts. When a bank lends money to its customer, the obligation of the customer is to repay the loan….Thus the obligation of a borrower in a loan contract as opposed to other types of contracts is to repay the loan and not the performance of the purpose for which the loan was sought.”  In my view, the above case applies mutatis mutandis to the issue of the appellant’s counterclaim which had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the seizure of the respondent’s tractors by the appellant bank did not release the respondent company of its primary obligation under the loan contract. In this case, the respondent owed the appellant an obligation to repay the loan, whether or not there was a breach occasioned by the appellant. The primary obligation to repay the loan had not changed and its obligation was not dependent on the performance of the purpose of the loan or a breach of contract by the appellant bank.  The issue of the quantum of damages for breach has been dealt with by my learned brother and I have nothing to add in that regard.  I agree that the appeal be dismissed in part.  (SGD) J. ANSAH  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  BAFFOE-BONNIE J.S.C:  I agree that the appeal be allowed in part.  (SGD) P. BAFFOE-BONNIE  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT  AKOTO BAMFO \[MRS.\] J.S.C:  I have had the privilege of reading the well-researched opinion of my learned and respected brother Dr. Date-Bah JSC.

"JUDGMENT  HONYENUGA, J.A.  This is an appeal by the defendants/appellants hereinafter called the appellants against the Ruling of the High Court, Land Division, Accra dated the 29th July 2011. The said ruling had restrained both parties from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the final determination of the suit.  The facts which resulted in this appeal are that, the plaintiffs/respondents hereinafter called the respondents claiming to be the head of the Obeney We family of Teshie and Sraha and the Wulomo of La and Teshie respectively are owners of the Sraha lands and have been in possession since time immemorial. The respondents also claimed that the appellants are their licencees who now claim as allodial owners and obtained a provisional certificate from the Land Title Registry which certificate had since been declared irregular. The appellants had relied on the said irregular certificate and made grants of parcels of the said Sraha lands to others claiming to be the owners of the said land. As a result the respondents instituted the instant action against the appellants claiming:-  “i. Declaration of Title to all that piece or parcel of land known as the Sraha Lands covering an approximate area of 312.68 acres, the boundaries of which are as follows:-  On the North, bounded by the road from Ashale Botwe towards the University of Ghana, Agricultural Research Station, commencing from a point marked OF1 in an easterly direction with the said road as a boundary and measuring 980 feet to the point marked OF2 and OF3, and the boundary, like the said University Farm road, descending in a South Easterly direction and measuring between points OF3 and OF4, 180 feet and between OF4 and OF5, 800 feet and between points marked OF5 and OF6, another 800 feet and between the points marked OF6 and OF7, a distance of 1400 feet and the boundary descends sharply in a Southerly direction and measuring between points OF7 and OF8, a distance of 1440 feet with Nmaidzor Village, constituting the South-Eastern boundary and between points OF8 and OF9, a distance of 2010 feet and the boundary taking a sharp Westerly direction and measuring between points OF9 and OF10, a distance of 630 feet and bounded on that side by Otinshie and Dzornaaman Villages and the boundary taking a sharp straight Northerly direction and between points OF11 and OF12, a distance of 980 feet, between OF12 and OF13, a distance of 1490 feet and bounded on that side by Onukpai Wohe, and between points OF13 and OF14, a distance of 1520 feet and bounded on that side by Ogodzo village and farms which boundary passes through a sand/stone pit and between OF14 and OF15, a distance of 680 feet and between points OF15 and OF1 a distance of 990 feet and bounded on that side by Freeman’s land.  ii. Recovery of possession of the entire land.  iii. Damages for Trespasses  iv. Further or other relief as in the circumstance may be just or proper including in particular, a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants whether by themselves, their servants, agents, privies whomsoever or otherwise from dealing or interfering with the plaintiffs ownership, possession and/or control of the said tract of land know as SRAHA land or any part thereof.  v. An order directed at the Land Title Registry to withdraw any Land Title Certificate issued to any party under any purported grant other than by the Obeney We family”.  The 1st – 3rd appellants entered appearance while the 4th appellant also filed theirs separately. The 1st – 3rd appellants filed a statement of defence and claimed that they are owners in possession of land known as Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands situate partly between South-East of the Motorway from Nkwantanang to the University of Ghana Farm and partly North-East of the Onukpai Wohe stream at Sraha near Ashalebotwe – Accra and more particularly contained in the attached schedule ‘A’ which boundaries were confirmed by the judgment of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 24/2002, Adjetey Agbosu & Ors. vrs Ebenezer Nikoi Kotei. The appellants claimed that by the said judgment their family was adjudged the allodial owners of the land in dispute. After stating the history of the land, the appellants alleged that the respondents were estopped from asserting any claim or title to the lands having stood by while the land was litigated from 1993 to 2004. The schedule ‘A’ is as follows:-  SCHEDULE  “A declaration to all that piece or parcel of land known as Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands situate between South East of the Motor Road from Nkwantanang to the University farm and partly North-East of the Onukpai Wohe stream respectively at Sraha near Ashalebotwe-Accra in the Tema District of Greater Accra Region of the Republic of Ghana the boundary where of commencing at a pillar marked AFF 20A which pillar marks the North-Western Corner of the said site for Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands and is 119.4 feet on a bearing of 132’30’ further bearing together with all further bearings hereinafter mentioned is referred to Meridian to West Longitude from a pillar marked SG. E9/57/607 the boundary runs on a bearing of 96o 151 for 480.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.21 and thence on a bearing of 93o 301 for 525.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.22 and thence on a bearing of 92o 301 for 765.2 feet to a pillar marked AAF.23 and thence on a bearing of 1111 001 for 120.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.24 and thence on a bearing of 1321 00 for 1450.2 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.25 to a pillar marked AAF.26 and thence on a bearing of 136o 301 for 790.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.27 which pillar is at the junction of the said Motor road from Nkwantanang to University Farm and a Motor road from Adiringano to Nkwantanang and thence on a bearing of 179o 00 for 290.0feet to a pillar marked AAF.28 and thence on a bearing of 169o 30 for 300 feet to a pillar marked AAF.29 and thence on a bearing of 181o 00 for 350.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.30 and thence on a bearing of 200o 00 for 560 feet to a pillar marked AAF.7 and thence on a bearing of 200o 151 for 842.5 feet to a pillar marked AAF.8 and thence on a bearing of 199o 57 for 804.2 feet to a pillar marked AAF.9 and thence on a bearing of 201o 061 for 482.5 feet to a pillar marked AAF.10 and thence on a bearing of 199o 35 for 737.0 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.11 to a point which is at the Easter side of a pond and thence follows the North Easter side of the Onukpai Wohe Stream for a distance of 4775 feet approximately to a point and thence on a bearing of 190 181 for 1179.4 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.17 to a pillar marked AAF.18 and thence on a bearing of 19o 27 for 490.0 feet to the point of commencement thus enclosing an area of 351.00 acre be the several dimensions little more or less as the same premises are more particularly delineated and shown edged pink on the certified plan herewith attached”.  The 4th appellant also filed a statement of defence in which it was stated that it processed a Land Title Certificate for the 1st – 3rd appellants but due to the litigation mentioned by the 1st – 3rd appellants and a caveat received and therefore a caveat was imposed on the Land Title Certificate. It was further stated that the litigation terminated at the Supreme Court whereby the 1st – 3rd appellants were given judgment. Thereafter, a substantive Land Title Certificate was granted to the 1st – 3rd appellants.  Application for Directions were taken and hearing of the matter commenced. Meanwhile, the respondents filed a motion for Interim Injunction “to restrain the appellants, its assigns, privies, agents and workmen from dealing in any way or interfering with the land the subject matter of this suit”. In the accompanying affidavit sworn to by the 1st respondent, he avers in paragraphs 6 to 10 as follows:-  “6. That whilst the suit is pending and the matters in controversy have not yet been determined by this Honourable Court, the Defendants, acting by their agents, assigns, privies, and workmen have been developing the land which is the subject matter of this suit. Copies of pictures taken at the site are attached and marked as follows:- ‘OS’1, OS’2, OS’3, OS’4 and OS’5.  7\. That I am advised by Counsel and verily believe that the conduct of the defendants, even though a restraining order has not been obtained from this Honourable Court, undermines the entire judicial process.  8\. That the defendants, whiles the matter is pending have been developing the land to the extent that if care is not taken, their conduct shall over reach the purpose for which this action is pending, or was instituted.  9\. That in the result, I am advised by Counsel and verily believe that it would serve the best interest of justice that whilst the matter is pending, an order of an interim injunction is granted restraining the defendants, their servants, agents, assigns and workmen from interfering with the subject matter of this suit”.  In their affidavit, the 1st respondent stated that he would refer to the pleadings as filed. In their statement of case, the respondents referred to Order 25 rule 1 of C.I. 47 to the effect that it granted to the Court a discretion to grant an order of interlocutory injunction. They also referred to the classical cases of Poutney v Doegah \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 111 at 115; Tokosi v Abas \[1972\] 1 GLR 257; Vanderpuye v Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428 at 432 C.A.; Food Specialities (Gh) Ltd. v Technicas De Muti Construction S.A. \[1987-88\] GLR 25 C.A.; Frimpong v Nana Asere Obeng II \[1974\] 1 GLR 16; Botwe v Edwey II \[1991\] GLR 179 at 182 C.A.; and Odonkor v Amartei \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 578 Holding 1 in support of their application.  Upon service of the application, the appellants filed an affidavit in opposition through their Counsel Mr. Ken Brookman-Amissah who averred in paragraphs 3 to 8 as follows:-  “3. That the respondents are opposed to the instant application filed on 30th June 2011. That the said application is bereft of any merit and lacks sound legal basis.  4\. That the respondents deny paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the affidavit in support of the instant application and further say that the annexed exhibits fail to substantiate the plaintiffs/applicants’ (the applicants) allegations.  5\. That the respondents aver that the said exhibits ‘OS1’ to ‘OS5’ have no probative value and have been merely contrived by the applicants to provide a false pretext for this application. That noting in the said exhibits establishes any link whatsoever to the respondents.  6\. That the status quo as of date is that the respondents have been adjudged owners in possession of the land subject matter of this dispute, their claim to title having been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of In re Ashalley Botwe; Adjetey Agbosu & Ors. v Kotey & Ors. \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 420.  7\. That consequent upon the said judgment the respondents’ families, i.e. the Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman families, have been duly registered in the Land Registry as proprietors of the land in dispute. That copy of the relevant land certificate dated 26th July 2005 is herewith annexed and marked as exhibit ‘1’.  8\. That this Court is duty bound to protect the respondents’ title to the disputed land as affirmed by the Supreme Court, pending the final determination of the substantive matter”.  In their statement of case, they relied on some English authorities, the same Vanderpuye v Natey (supra),Contracor Resources Ltd. v Boahene & Ors. \[1992-93\] GBR Part 4 1512 C.A. at p.1516.  On the 29th day of July 2011, the learned trial judge after hearing Counsel for the parties and perusing the respective affidavits and their statement of case ruled as follows:-  “To hold the balance evenly between the parties, all parties and their agents, servants, privies, assigns, workmen etc. are restrained from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the determination of this suit.  The plaintiffs should give an undertaking as envisaged under Order 25 Rule 9(1) before this order is drawn up and signed”.  The respondent accordingly gave an undertaking which appears on page 60 of the record of appeal.  Aggrieved by the ruling of the trial Court, the appellants filed the instant appeal based on the following grounds:-  “a) That the ruling was erroneous in law and amounted to a wrongful exercise of discretion.  b) That the trial judge failed to appreciate that on the face of the pleadings and affidavit evidence the appellants had a relatively stronger case which should have warranted a refusal of the application for interlocutory injunction, to wit;  i. The appellants were in physical possession and occupation of the disputed land.  ii. The appellants legal right to the land by a previous judgment of the Supreme Court which guaranteed title to them unless otherwise determined.  iii. The appellants were in possession of a Land Title Certificate concerning the disputed land which guaranteed title to them unless otherwise determined.  iv. There was no proof that the photographic exhibits relied upon by the plaintiffs/respondents concerned any portion of the land in dispute.  v. The plaintiffs/respondents failed to annex to their application, as exhibit any survey map relating to the land in respect of which they sought the injunctive order.  c. That additional grounds of appeal shall be filed upon receipt of the record”.  It is noted that the appellants did not file additional grounds of appeal as indicated in their Notice of Appeal and they are therefore considered abandoned.  I will start with ground (b). A perusal of the ground of appeal as stated in ground (b) offends Rule 8(5) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1997, C.I. 19. It provides:-  “(5) The grounds of appeal shall set out concisely and under distinct heads of grounds upon which the appellant intends to rely at the hearing of the appeal without any argument or narrative and shall be numbered consecutively”.  The ground (b) is argumentative and narrative and therefore it was contrary to law and procedure and same is hereby dismissed. See Akiwiye v Agyekum \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 179 C.A.  Now, to ground (a) that the ruling was erroneous in law and amounted to a wrongful exercise of discretion. Arguing this ground, learned Counsel for the appellants referred to Crentsil v Crentsil \[1962\] GLR 171 at 175 C.A. to support his contention that it was settled law that an appeal against the exercise of a lower court’s discretion can only succeed if it can be established that the lower Court misapprehended the facts and thereby exercised its discretion on wrong or inadequate materials or gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters. He submitted that by virtue of the Supreme Court judgment and the Land Title Certificate, the appellants had acquired a guaranteed title unless otherwise directed by a Court of competent jurisdiction. He referred to Chantel v Koi \[2010\] 34 MLRG 150 at 161 C.A.  Order 25 rule 1(1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004, C.I. 47 provides the procedure for dealing with interlocutory injunctions. The order is as follows:-  “(1) The Court may grant an injunction by an interlocutory order in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just and convenient to do so, and the order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers it just”.  Order 25 rule 1(1) thus gives discretionary power to the Court to grant an injunction where it deems it just and convenient to do so. Further, order 25 rule (2) requires a party to an action to apply for the grant of an injunction before or after the trial of the action whether a claim for an injunction was included in the party’s writ, counterclaim or third party notice. Order 25 rule 1(3) requires an applicant or a party seeking an injunction to attach a motion paper and its supporting affidavit, a statement of case setting out full arguments including all relevant legal authorities in support of the application. Moreover, a respondent who desires to oppose the application is obliged to file an affidavit in opposition as well as a Statement of Case setting out full arguments and the legal authorities to be relied on. In the instant appeal, both parties have complied with the stated procedure in order 25 rule 1 sub rule (3) and (4).  The Courts have recently considered the dictum of Lord Diplock in American Cyananud Co. Ltd. v Ethicon Ltd. \[1975\] 1 All ER 504 HL as follows:-  “The Court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious, in other word, that there is a serious question to be tried”.  See also Vanderpuye v Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428 C.A.  Further, in granting interlocutory injunctions the Court takes into consideration not only the existence of a legal or equitable right of the applicant, but whether on the balance of convenience, the applicant would suffer irreparable injury or greater harm which could not be adequately compensated for in damages. A determination of the said principles involves a consideration of the pleadings and the affidavit before the Court. See Owusu v Owusu-Ansah and Anor. \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 870 Holding 1 as follows:-  “(1) the granting or refusal of an injunction is at the discretion of the trial court but that discretion ought to be exercised judiciously …. The fundamental principle in applications for interim injunction is whether the applicant has a legal right at law or in equity, which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits. This could only be determined by considering the pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court”.  It was also held in Odonkor and Others v Amartei \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 578 Holding 1 as follows:-  “(1) the basic purpose of interim orders, was as much as possible to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was one or one that brought him more problems than blessings”.  In the instant appeal, the learned trial judge granted the respondents’ application by restraining both parties. I agree with the trial judge. It is noted that the respondents by their pleadings claim that the land is their ancestral property and that the appellants are on the land in dispute as licencees. The appellants have also claimed that by a Supreme Court judgment, they had been declared the owners and are in possession.  However, the respondents have by their reply stated that they had no notice, neither were they parties or privies to the matter in the Courts. Further the exhibits OS1 to OS8 attached to the affidavit in support of the motion for injunction indicate that there are developments on the land in dispute in the nature of buildings being put up thereon. It is further noted that the appellants by their paragraphs 4 and 5 of the affidavit in opposition (supra) stated that the respondents failed to substantiate their allegations and that the attached exhibits have no probative value. They also deposed to the fact that the said exhibits established no link to them. The said paragraphs indicate that the appellants had nothing to do with the developments on the land in dispute and have therefore denied knowledge of those developments. Since the appellants have not denied that the developments on the land were not on the ascertained boundaries of the land in dispute, they would have nothing to lose if the injunction was granted. I entirely agree with the trial judge on his findings on this. It is trite that a person in possession of land could be restrained by injunction from using the land, see Yakubu II v Abdulai II \[1984-86\] 2 GLR 231 S.C. It is therefore right that the trial judge injuncted the parties despite the possession of a Supreme Court judgment by the appellants, especially when the appellants have denied the developments on the land in dispute. It is trite that res judicata could be proved by the adduction of evidence – see Moasa Co. v Scara \[1999-2000\] 1 GLR 538 C.A. Holding 1. In the instant case, the judgment in the possession of the appellants could only be proved by adducing evidence to establish any relevance of it to the land in dispute and the respondents. On the balance of convenience, the respondents would suffer greater harm which should not be adequately compensated for in damages if those buildings were to continue on the land.  Moreover, it is interesting to observe that both parties appear more concerned with the order of interlocutory injunction than the substantive suit itself and the order restraining them will redirect attention to the main action and to its early disposal. It is noted that this action is part-heard before the trial Court and the confirmation of the order for injunction would therefore speed up the trial.  Furthermore, in accordance with Order 25 rule 9 of C.I. 47, the learned trial judge ordered the respondents bound to undertake to pay damages to the appellants if it turned out that at the end of the matter the respondents were not entitled to the order. Order 25 rule 9 provides:-  “9(1) Where an application is made under rules 1 and 2 of this Order, the Court shall, if the application is opposed, require before making an order that the applicant shall give an undertaking to the person opposing the application to pay any damages that person may suffer as a result of the grant of the application if it turns out in the end that the applicant was not entitled to the order.  (2) The giving of an undertaking required under subrule (1) shall be a precondition to the making of any order under rules 1 and 2 of this order.  (3) Where an applicant gives the undertaking, the court shall at the end of the proceedings in which the undertaking was given assess the damages, if any, which the person who opposed the application has suffered and which the applicant is liable to pay and shall give such judgment as the circumstances require”.  The respondents duly undertook to pay the damages as ordered by the trial judge to balance the scales of justice evenly to avoid any lose to the appellants should the respondents fail to make a case. In the end, the appellants could be adequately compensated in damages if the respondents lose the case at the trial court. See Ballmoos v Mensah \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 724 C.A. See also Republic v High Court, Koforidua; Ex parte Ansah-Otoo & Anor. (KOANS BUILDING SOLUTIONS LTD. INTERESTED PARTY) \[2009\] SCGLR 141; 144.  I now consider whether the trial judge exercised his discretion wrongfully. In Sappor v Wigatap Ltd. \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 676, the Supreme Court held that:-  “The well known and time honoured legal principle is that an appeal against a decision based on the exercise of a court’s discretionary jurisdiction would succeed in only those exceptional cases where in sum, the Judge failed to act, judiciously. The applicable principles are, an appellate court, would interfere with the exercise of discretion where the court below applied wrong principles or conclusions reached would work manifest injustice or aver that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate material, arbitrary, capricious etc. Uninformed conclusions stand in danger of being reversed”.  See also Owusu v Owusu-Ansah \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 870. In the instant case, the learned trial judge from the record of appeal, exercised his discretion judiciously by considering the pleadings and the affidavits and came to the right conclusion that both parties be restrained.  The learned trial judge having rightly exercised his discretion and having considered the balance of convenience and that the respondents’ case was not frivolous and vexatious, the trial judge was right in restraining the parties and their agents, privies, assigns, workmen etc. from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the determination of the suit. The ground of appeal fails.  The appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed. Order of interlocutory injunction granted by the High Court, Land Division, Accra on the 29th day of July 2011 together with the consequential orders made are hereby affirmed.  (SGD.)  C. J.

"R U L I N G  MARFUL –SAU, JA:-The fundamental issue raised in this application is whether this court was seised with jurisdiction when on the 20th day of December 2012 it granted an application for interim injunction pending the determination of an appeal lodged by the Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent herein against the refusal of the High Court, Fast Track Division to grant an application for interlocutory injunction.  The main ground canvassed by counsel for Defendant/Respondent/Applicant herein in seeking to set aside the order granting the injunction is that this court was not seised with jurisdiction because as at the 20th day of December 2012, when this court granted the injunction the record of appeal had not been transmitted to this court and Form 6 had not been issued by the Registrar of the court below, that is the High Court, Fast Track Division.  We are being called upon, in this application, to examine the conduct of this court as it sat on the 20th December 2012, to ascertain whether it had jurisdiction to grant the injunction. In other words we are to ascertain whether the court erred in granting the application for injunction pending an appeal against the refusal of an injunction by a lower court in the peculiar circumstances of the case, when the record of appeal had not been transmitted to this court. In conducting this exercise we will like to briefly address the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. It is trite learning that an appeal is a creature of Statute and an appellate jurisdiction can only be exercised when the appellant has brought himself/herself within the law creating the appeal.  In Frimpong v. Poku(1962) 2 GLR 1 at 6 the Supreme Court held thus:-  “A right of appeal is always conferred by statute, and when the statute conferring the right lays down conditions precedent to the raising of that right in a litigant, it is essential that those conditions must be strictly performed otherwise that right does not become vested.”  An appeal is deemed to be entered at the Court of Appeal when Form 6 is issued by the Registrar of the court below. The issuance of Form 6 means that the records of appeal are transmitted from the trial court to the Court of Appeal. There is no dispute in law as to when an appeal is deemed to have been entered in the appellate court as the authorities are legion on this matter. In Ampong V Frempong (1965) GLR 350, the Supreme Court speaking through Mills-Odoi JSC, delivered as follows:-  “In our opinion the appeal is entered, or is deemed to have been entered, the moment the registrar of the Supreme Court receives the record and all the accompanying documents listed in Rule 15(1) of the aforesaid Rules. It will be observed that the docket on the file which contains all relevant materials for the due prosecution of the appeal would have, at that state, been transmitted from the court below to this court. On receipt of these documents the court below becomes functus officio; the Supreme Court then becomes seised of the whole of the proceeding as between the parties hereto and until the appeal is finally determined every application therein shall be made to the court and not to the court below, but any application may be filed in the court below for transmission to the court.”  Then in Ashanti Goldfields Company Ltd v. Westchester Resources Ltd, (unreported Ruling of the Supreme Court, presided over by a single Justice, Dr. Date-Bah JSC, in civil motion No. J8/29/2013 of 27th March 2013)the learned Jurist discussing issues regarding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court held among others as follows:-  “On the face of this provision, before the transmission of the record of appeal to the Supreme Court, it does not have jurisdiction to deal with interlocutory matters relating to a particular appeal, unless an application can be granted on any of its other bases of jurisdiction such as its supervisory jurisdiction.”  It is thus clear that generally an appellate court like the Court of Appeal can only invoke its jurisdiction when an appeal is properly entered at its Registry; that is, when the entire record of appeal is received at its Registry after the issuance of Civil Form 6 by the Registrar of the court below.  The facts of this case are that the Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent applied for an interlocutory injunction at the High Court/Fast Track Division and was refused. The Respondent herein then filed an appeal in this court against the order refusing the injunction on 29th July 2012. The Respondent filed an application for an interim injunction pending the final determination of the appeal against the order refusing the injunction. On the 20th December 2012 this court differently composed then granted the application by ordering an injunction against the Defendant/Respondent/Applicant herein. It is this order that the Applicant herein seeks to set aside on grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to so make the order.  What then is the jurisdiction of this court to entertain interlocutory applications? This court’s jurisdiction on interlocutory applications is clearly defined by Rules 21, 27A and 28 of C1 19, which provides as follows:  “21. Control of Proceedings during Pendency of Appeal:  ‘’ after the record of appeal has been transmitted from the court below to the court, the court shall be seised of the whole of the proceedings as between the parties and every application shall be made to the court and not to the court below, but an application may be filed in the court below for transmission to the court.”  In reviewing the above Rule in the context of the instant proceedings, it is clear that the Respondent’s application for interim injunction which was granted by this court could not have been prosecuted under Rule 21, since at the time of the application the record of appeal had not been transmitted from the court below to this court. What does Rules 27 A and 28 provide?  Rule 27 A: Interlocutory Appeals.  “The court may in an interlocutory appeal civil or criminal before it grant a stay of proceedings pending the determination of the interlocutory appeal subject to the conditions the court considers fit.”  Again under this rule the only application that this court is mandated to grant is one of stay of proceedings and not an order of interim injunction. Rule 27A is followed by Rule 28 which is titled “Court to which application should be made” and provides as follows:  “28. Subject to these Rules and to any other enactment, where under an enactment, an application may be made to the court below or to the court, it shall be made in the first instance to the court below, but if the court below refuses to grant the application, the applicant is entitled to have the application determined by the court.”  The above rule 28 is speaking to what is commonly referred to in our civil procedure practice as repeat applications. Our understanding of the rule is that before an application could be repeated in the court of appeal after its refusal by the court below an enactment must give right to the repetition of the application. Few examples of such applications that specific enactments sanction the right to repeat in the Court of Appeal are as follows:  (a)Application for Stay of Execution when an appeal is filed  (b)Motion for extension of time to file an appeal against a final judgment and  (c)Motion for leave to appeal against the interlocutory order of the Circuit Court.  It is important to state that by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Republic v. Fast Track High Court, Accra, Exparte Daniel Kwasi Abodakpi, Civil Motion No. JS/15/2005 dated 25th October 2005, the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain application of stay of proceedings so there can’t be a repeat application to the Court of Appeal, since the application must now be made directly to the Court of Appeal.  Flowing from the requirement in Rule 28 we do not know of any enactment which stipulates that if an application for interlocutory injunction is refused by a trial court and an appeal is taken the application can be repeated as of right. No such enactment has been referred to us by counsel for the Respondent who is opposing the instant application. That being the case the only Rule of this court that could have aided the Respondent is Rule 21, but as observed, at the time the application for interim injunction was heard by this court, the record of appeal had not been transmitted to this court nor had the Registrar of the court below issued civil Form 6 to the parties in this proceedings. As observed the application for interim injunction could also not be taken as a repeat application since no enactment gives that right to the Respondent herein.  Indeed our understanding of the nature and essence of repeat applications in this court is not to create an opportunity for the court to determine the appeal, at best it is generally targeted at maintaining the status quo ante, pending the final determination of the appeal. In this proceedings however, the effect of the order was the determination of the appeal itself through the application.  In his Notice of Appeal filed on 20th July 2012 the Respondent in this proceeding sought the following major reliefs:-  (a)An order to set aside the ruling of the High court on the Plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory injunction.  (b)An order for an interlocutory injunction pending the final determination of the suit at the High Court.  The remedy that the Respondent was seeking upon the determination of the appeal is a decree of interlocutory injunction against the Applicant herein. The appeal was calling on this court to determine whether the trial court was right or wrong in refusing the Respondent application for interlocutory injunction. By granting an order of interim injunction against the Applicant herein without hearing the appeal on its merit, since the record was not before the court, this court indirectly granted the reliefs sought in the appeal. What this court did when it granted the order of interim injunction was hearing the appeal without having the record of appeal.  As addressed in this ruling since the application for injunction could not be taken as a repeat application, we are of the opinion that this court could only have entertained the application if the record of appeal had been transmitted to its Registry and Civil Form 6 issued to vest the court with the requisite jurisdiction to hear same.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': 'CIVIL MOTION'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2014, 'month': 'February', 'day': 20}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'ACQUAYE, JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2014\\MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.', 'short': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'}}"
"J U D G M E N T  A. M. DOMAKYAAREH (MRS), J.A.  1\. The appellant in this case was charged with two criminal offences in the Kumasi High Court, namely:-  i.Conspiracy to commit robbery contrary to Sections 23(1) and 149 of Act 29/60 as amended by Act 646 and  ii.Robbery contrary to Section 149 of Act 29/60 as amended by Act 646 of 2003  After the trial, he was convicted on both counts on 13th June 2007 and sentenced to 25 years Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL) on each of the two counts to run concurrently. The appellant filed the instant appeal pursuant to leave granted by this Court on 25th November 2014.  2\. THE FACTS OF THE CASE:  The facts of the case as found at pages 3 to 4 of the Record of Appeal disclose that the Complainant; (one Samuel Frimpong) is a trader who lives at Buokrom. On 8th April 2006 at about 9:20pm, a customer went to the complainant’s shop in order to buy mobile phone units. The customer gave his mobile phone to the complainant to load the units. In the process of loading the units, the appellant who was a pillion rider on a motor cycle arrived and demanded that the complainant should hand over the phone to him. The rider of the motor cycle is still at large. The appellant, who was armed with a pistol pointed it at the complainant and threatened to kill him if he did not comply with the order to hand over the phone.  A Security Officer at Churchill Hotel which was close by saw what was happening and ordered the appellant and his accomplice to stop. The appellant pointed his pistol at the Security Officer. The security officer who was armed fired and a bullet hit the appellant in the eye. The appellant dropped his pistol and he and his accomplice managed to escape. Some of the bullets from the gun fired by the security officer hit other people who came to the scene and they were taken to the hospital for treatment. At the Hospital, the complainant and one of the injured saw the appellant and identified him. The appellant told the medical officer that he was hurt by an iron rod. An X-ray revealed that he was hit by a bullet. He then claimed that he was shot by his friend with whom he was quarrelling and named several people as witnesses. When the people were contacted they said they did not know the appellant. The appellant could not also lead the Police to arrest the person who allegedly attacked and shot him.  3\. The appellant is fighting his conviction and sentence on three grounds, namely:-  a.The Court erred when it convicted the accused on circumstantial evidence and this occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice  b.The trial judge erred when he failed to give reasons for the conviction and this rendered the whole trial a nullity.  c.The sentence of twenty-five years I. H. L. is harsh and excessive in the light of the circumstances of the case.  We proceed to consider the grounds of appeal seriatim in the light of the evidence available in the Record of Appeal.  4\. GROUND (a) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:  The Court erred when it convicted the accused on circumstantial evidence and this occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Counsel for the appellant quoted the revised version of Section 23(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act 1960 (Act 29) as follows:-  “If two or more persons agree to act together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime, whether with or without any previous concert or deliberation, each of them is guilty of conspiracy to commit or abet that crime as the case may be” (emphasis supplied by Counsel).  He then proceeded to list four ingredients that the Prosecution ought to establish to secure a conviction for conspiracy as follows:-  “1. That there must be two or more persons  2\. That the persons must agree to act together  3\. That they held a common purpose and;  4\. That the common purpose must be either to commit or abet a crime”.  Counsel for the appellant then argued that since there was no evidence whatsoever to establish in anyway either directly or otherwise that the accused did agree together with the one other (at large) to act together to commit the alleged robbery, the prosecution had failed to prove the ingredient of “previous agreement” hence the prosecution’s case ought to fail.  5\. The wording in the above above quotation of “Section 23(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29)” has changed slightly in the current position of the law. The current wording of Section 23(1) of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29) provides as follows:-  “23. Conspiracy  (1)Where two or more persons agree or act together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a criminal offence, whether with or without a previous concert or deliberation, each of them commits a conspiracy to commit or abet the criminal offence”.  Even going by the Section 23(1) version of Counsel for the appellant, he chose to severe the section and place emphasis on “agree together” and ignore or jettison “whether with or without any previous concert or deliberation” which also appears in his version. This is, to say the least, very disingenuous, as by so doing, Counsel was probably inadvertently dabbling in the English law on conspiracy which is different from the Ghana law on conspiracy. Case law and academic text books on the subject amply demonstrate the difference between English law on conspiracy and Ghana law on conspiracy.  6\. In the case of COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VRS AFARI AND ADDO (1962)1 GLR 483, the appellants were charged with conspiracy to defraud by false pretences and duly convicted. The first appellant was also convicted on a second count of defrauding by false pretences, and the second appellant was convicted on a third count of aiding and abetting the first appellant. Both appealed against their convictions.  In the Supreme Court it was argued among others that there was no evidence of an agreement between the appellants and that since the only evidence adduced was in respect of the substantive charge of fraud by false pretences, it was irregular to include in the charge a count of conspiracy. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal stating unequivocally that: -  “In the opinion of the Court, the Ghana law of conspiracy is wider in scope and in content than the English law on the subject. It consists not only in the criminal agreement between two minds, but also in the acting together in furtherance of a common criminal offence.”  P. K. Twumasi, in his Book “Criminal Law in Ghana” at page 106 thereof reiterates the position as follows:-  “Our law is wider in the sense that while it is essential to prove a previous agreement in all cases of conspiracy in English law a person may be convicted in Ghana for conspiracy even though there is no proof of such previous agreement. To succeed in a charge of conspiracy the prosecution may prove either  (1) That the accused agreed together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime  Or  (2)That the accused persons acted together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime”.  7\. From the evidence in the Record of Appeal, the Prosecution proved overt acts by the appellant and his accomplice at large which showed that they acted together with a common purpose to commit the criminal offence of robbery by these incidents:-  �The appellant was a pillion rider on a motor driven by his accomplice (page three (3) of the Record of Appeal  �The complainant (PW1 Samuel Frimpong) and the Security Guard (PW2 Kwasi Boateng) at pages 9 and 10 of the Record of Appeal respectively stated that both the appellant and his accomplice ordered the complainant to hand over the phone to them and that they pointed rifles on the complainant and the customer who went to buy the phone units.  These acts of the appellant and his accomplice are direct acts which satisfy the requirements of Ghana law and are in no way circumstantial as Counsel for the appellant would want this court to believe.  8\. Under the first ground of appeal, Counsel for the appellant also canvassed very strenuously that the only evidence linking the accused to the offence was circumstantial evidence. There is however the direct evidence of eyewitnesses to the robbery who positively identified the accused. These are the complainant Samuel Frimpong (PW1) and Kwasi Boateng the Security Guard at the Churchill Hotel (PW2). PW1’s sister who was at the Komfo Anokye Hospital when the appellant was sent to that hospital called PW1 and informed him that one of the robbers had been brought to the hospital. The case of ADU BOAHENE VRS THE REPUBLIC \[1972\] GLR 70 comes in point. The complainant in this case, a petrol dealer, alleged that he was violently robbed at about 9 p.m. one evening while carrying money in a bag from his petrol filling station to his house. Not long after the robbery he took the police to the house of the appellant whom he identified as one of the three robbers. He alleged that he had known the appellant at his filling station for about two years and this was confirmed by one of his attendants at the station. The appellant denied the allegation against him and said that since he was not at the scene of the crime at all, the witnesses were mistaken. The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant was one of the robbers. The jury accepted the evidence of the prosecution and he was consequently convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labour. He appealed on the main ground that the sentence was excessive and also that there was insufficient evidence of his identity. In dismissing the appeal, the court held per holding (1) that “where the identity of an accused person is in issue, there can be no better proof of his identity than the evidence of a witness who swears to have seen the accused committing the offence charged.”  9\. This direct evidence was not of concern to the appellant and his counsel. Their beef was that no medical report was tendered at the trial to indicate that the injury to the eye was from a gunshot and that no ballistic expert was called as a witness to testify that the injury to the eye of the appellant was shot from the gun of the Security Guard.  Relying on circumstantial evidence is not new to the law. The only constraint is that for circumstantial evidence to succeed in the conviction of an accused person, it must point to one and only one conclusion. Among the bevy of authorities that espouse this position of the law is DEXTER JOHNSON V THE REPUBLIC (2011) SCGLR 601 AT 605 where at holding 1, the Supreme Court delivered itself thus: -  “Circumstantial evidence was quite usual as it was rare to prove an offence by evidence of eyewitnesses; and inferences from facts proved might prove the guilt of the appellant. A presumption from circumstantial evidence should be drawn against the appellant only when that presumption would follow irresistibly from the circumstances proved in evidence; and in order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the appellant and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt.”  10\. It is worthy of note that the appellant changed the story of the injury to his eye but eventually settled on gunshot injury when he was confronted with the medical finding backed by the X-ray report. At page 4 of the Record of Appeal the appellant told the medical officer that he was hurt by an iron rod. When this did not work, he told the doctor that he fought with a friend who shot him in the eye (See page 16 of the Record of Appeal) but he failed to go and identify that friend to the Police. Besides when the investigator (PW3) No. 33930 D/L Corporal Daniel Adodo testified in his examination-in-chief that PW2, who shot the appellant came to inform the Police that he shot the accused, he did not challenge this evidence. When PW2 also testified that he shot the accused, he did not challenge him. It is thus our considered opinion that these circumstances lead to the irresistible and inevitable conclusion that the eye injury was as a result of the gun shot fired by PW2 and for that reason any other witnesses, whether medical officer and or ballistic expert would have been surplusage. The accused himself ultimately admitted that the injury to his eye was from a gunshot.  It is the quality and not the quantity of witnesses that determines whether the required standard of proof has been met. In this case the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3 was sufficient to identify who caused the injury to the eye of the accused and how it was caused.  Ground (a) of the grounds of appeal therefore fails and is accordingly dismissed.  11\. GROUND (b) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:  That the trial judge erred when he failed to give reasons for the conviction and this rendered the whole trial a nullity.  Counsel for the appellant submitted that where an accused person pleads “not guilty” to a charge as in the instant case, the prosecution assumes the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He said the Court then has a duty to give reasons why it thinks that the prosecution has or has not discharged its burden of proof to demonstrate whether the conviction or acquittal is justifiable. Counsel submitted forcefully that every judgment must discuss the issues for determination and then settle each issue one way or the other giving reasons for each case why it has so determined the issue. He quoted S. 177(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences (Procedure) Act 1960 (Act 30), the current version of which is as follows:-  “177. The decision  (1)The Court, having heard the totality of the evidence, shall consider and determine the whole matter and may  (a)Convict the accused and pass sentence on, or make an order against the accused according to law, or  (b)Acquit the accused, and the court shall give its decision in the form of an oral judgment and shall record the decision briefly together with the reason for it, where necessary”.  Counsel cited the fairly old cases of COMMISSIONER OF POLICE V ASAMOAH (1958) 3 WALR 458; R.V. SARPONG \[1959\] GLR 383 and THE STATE V ANDOH (1962) 2 GLR 106 to buttress his point that reasons for a decision are necessary where there is a conviction. Counsel concluded by submitting that the failure of the court to give reasons for its decision to convict the appellant as well as the failure to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt rendered the entire judgment a nullity for which reason it ought to be set aside by this Court.  12\. We acknowledge that S. 177(1) of Act 30/60 is the relevant provision on decisions but it is however our considered opinion that the sub-section makes it permissible and not mandatory for a judge to assign reasons for arriving at a decision. This position is clearly deductible from the subsection which ends ... “and the Court shall give its decision in the form of an oral judgment, and shall record briefly together with the reasons for it, where necessary” (emphasis added). This position notwithstanding, there is no doubt that giving reasons for decisions should be encouraged as a sound policy and as a matter of judicial best practice as was stipulated by the Supreme Court in the case of TSATSU TSIKATA V REPUBLIC \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 106 and in the unreported case of this Court inDICKSON KWADWO MANU V THE REPUBLIC, CRIMINAL APPEAL 140/H2/01/2012 DATED 27TH APRIL 2012.  Failure by a judge to give reasons for its decision may indeed leave the reasonable mind to wallow in the realm of conjecture and assumptions as to why the court arrived at its decision as stated in the DICKSON KWADWO MANU case cited supra or give the possibly unwarranted impression of thoughtlessness, bias or even malice on the part of the decision maker as stated in theTSATSU TSIKATA case but definitely not enough to render the entire decision a nullity as canvassed by Counsel for the Respondent.  13\. The 1958, 1959 and 1962cases of COP VRS ASAMOAH; R. VRS SARPONG and THE STATE V ANDOH all cited supra are distinguishable. In the COP V ASAMOAH case the court also said “In our view, the reason for decision are necessary where there is a conviction, unless the reason is so clearly obvious and beyond doubt the guilt can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case”. (Emphasis added).  Besides, Section 406(1)(a) of Act 30/60 comes in handy as far as the instant case is concerned. Section 406(1)(a) of Act 30/60 provides as follows:-  “406. Finding or Sentence when reversible by reason of error or omission  (1)Subject to this part a finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or review on account  (a)of an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment, or any other proceedings before or during the trial or in an enquiry or any other proceedings under this act ... unless the error, omission, irregularity, or misdirection has in fact occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice” (emphasis added).  We are of the considered opinion that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case and we consequently dismiss ground (b) of the grounds of appeal.  14\. GROUND (c) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:  The sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment with hard labour is harsh in the light of the circumstances of the case.  Counsel for the appellant acknowledged the position of the law that the sentence a court may impose on an accused person either at a trial or on appeal is entirely within the discretion of the court. It is also not in dispute that where an appellant complains about the harshness of a sentence, he ought to appreciate that every sentence is supposed to serve a five-fold purpose, namely, to be punitive, calculated to deter others, to reform the offender, to appease the society and to be a safe-guard to the country. See the case of MOHAMMED KAMIL V THE REPUBLIC (2011) 30 GMJ I SC  Counsel however relied on the case of KWAKU FRIMPONG @ IBOMAN V THE REPUBLIC (2012) 1 SCGLR 297 where the Supreme Court stated that “It is also generally accepted that a first offender must normally be given a second opportunity to reform and play his or her role in society as a useful and law abiding citizen” and put in a plea of mitigation for the appellant. He said the appellant was 18 years at the time of his arrest in April 2006; had no criminal record at that time and that even though the appellant and his accomplice were armed, there was no loss of lives or injuries to the victim.  The case of KWASHIE V THE REPUBLIC (1971) 1 GLR 448 is very pertinent here. In this case, in collaboration with two other police officers, the first appellant used his office as a police detective to seize a large quantity of goods that had been smuggled into the country. Rather than sending the goods to the police station they were sent to the private house of one of the accomplices for the purpose of selling them for the benefit of all who participated. The appellants and their accomplices were found guilty of stealing and were each sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour. Counsel for the first appellant argued that the sentence was excessive, submitting among others: (1) that the trial judge gave no reasons for the severe sentence that he passed on the first appellant; (2) that having regard to the value of the goods stolen the sentence was excessive and (3) that the first appellant was a first offender and ought to have been more leniently dealt with. The court dismissed the appeal holding among others that:  “(1) When a trial judge is imposing a sentence on a convicted person there is no obligation on him to give reasons for the sentence that he passes.  (2) Since the offence was of a very grave nature, the sentence must not only have been punitive but it must also have been deterrent or exemplary in order to mark the disapproval of society of such conduct by police officers. When a court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the value of the subject-matter of the charge and the good record of the accused become irrelevant.”  Concerning the length of sentence, it was stated at page 493 thus: - “in determining the length of sentence, the factors which the trial judge is entitled to consider are:-  (i)The intrinsic seriousness of the offence  (ii)The degree of revulsion felt by law abiding citizens of the society for the particular crime.  (iii)The premeditation with which the criminal plan was executed  (iv)The prevalence of the crime within the particular locality  (v)The sudden increase in the incident of the particular crime”  15\. No one will deny that taking another person’s mobile phone at gun point is a serious or grave offence and no one will also deny that law abiding citizens abhor and detest robbery. The incidence of mobile phone snatching is quite prevalent in the country and was definitely on the increase at the time this offence was committed. The modus operandi of the appellant and his accomplice at large, namely, using a motor cycle in order to get away fast shows some strategic planning on their part. That being the case, we think the trial judge exercised his discretion rightly in his sentencing of the appellant. His sentence is in line with the case of ADU-BOAHEN VRS THE REPUBLIC cited supra where court also held that: -  “Where the court finds an offence to be grave, it must not only impose a punitive sentence, but also a deterrent or exemplary one so as to indicate the disapproval of society of that offence. Once the court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the good record of the accused is irrelevant”.  16\. The principle of sentencing is not just dictated by case law alone. There are clear and unambiguous statutory provisions on the ambit of sentences. Section 149(1) of Act 29/60 as amended by S 150 of Act 646 of 2003, the applicable law at the time of the commission of the offences in this case stipulates as follows:-  (1) whoever commits robbery is guilty of an offence and shall be liable, upon conviction on a trial summarily or on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, and where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon or offensive missile, the offender shall upon conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than fifteen years.”  It is to be noted that the applicable law provided a minimum sentence of 15 years where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon, guns in this instance, and provides no upper limit. One cannot therefore legally fault the trial judge for imposing a sentence of 25 years Imprisonment with Hard Labour as that falls within the law. Again the relevant part of Section 24(1) of Act 29/60 provides as follows: -  “24. Punishment for conspiracy.  (i)Where two or more persons are convicted of conspiracy for the commission or abetment of a criminal offence, each of them shall, where the criminal offence is committed, be punished for that criminal offence. ... “  We have already stated the punishment for robbery supra and same punishment should be imposed for the conviction for conspiracy since the offence itself has been committed. It is our considered view that the appellant should count himself lucky that the trial judge imposed the sentences to run concurrently. Ground three of the grounds of appeal is consequently dismissed.  17\. The learned trial judge however imposed the sentence to take effect from 8th April 2006, that being the day the offences were committed. Upon arrest, the appellant was also in lawful custody until 13th June 2007, the day he was convicted and sentenced. It is settled law that sentences are not passed retroactively. Section 315(3) of Criminal & Other Offences (Procedure) Act 1960 (Act 30) stipulates as follows: -  “315. Warrants to be issued in respect of sentence of imprisonment  (3) A sentence of imprisonment commences on and includes the day on which it is pronounced”.  Therefore the learned trial judge erred when he imposed the sentence to take effect from the day the offences were committed. What he is required by law to do is to take into account any period that the accused has spent in lawful custody in respect of that offence before the completion of the trial. This position finds its basis in no other but the Constitutional provision in Article 14(6) of the 1992 Fourth Republican Constitution of Ghana which stipulates as follows:-  “14(6) where a person is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence, any period he has spent in lawful custody in respect of that offence before the completion of his trial shall be taken into account in imposing the term of imprisonment”.  Accordingly, the sentence of the appellant is varied to twenty-three (23) years and nine (9) months Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL)with effect from 13th June 2007, the date on which he was convicted and sentenced.

"JUDGMENT  SOWAH, J.A:  In this judgment the parties will be referred to by their designations at the trial court.  Upon an application brought by the plaintiff/respondent herein, the trial High Court in a Ruling delivered on 25th June 2014 made an interlocutory injunction order against the defendants who are the appellants herein. The Order which related to the parcel of land in dispute was made subject to an undertaking by the plaintiff to pay damages to the defendants should it turn out at the final determination of the suit that she was not entitled to the Order.  The brief facts of the case is that the plaintiff sued for declaration of title to a parcel of land approximately 15.03 acres situate at NSUMIA near Nsawam said to have been granted to the company in 2004 by the Oprotee Odum family of Kwateman Adjen Kotoku and duly registered. The plaintiff stated that she had constructed a fence wall and an uncompleted structure and had enjoyed peaceful possession until 2013 when it decided to commence constructing a proposed factory on the land. Members of the defendants’ family and their agents had chased her workers away. Hence plaintiff took out the writ of summons for declaration of title, perpetual injunction and damages for trespass, among other reliefs. In her application for interim injunction which was brought under Order 19 rule 3 and Order 25 rule 1 of C.I. 47, the plaintiff exhibited her indenture registered in 2005 and a site plan of the land.  On their part the defendants filed an affidavit in opposition in which it was averred that the land was covered by a Deed of Declaration dated 12th March 2004 which was made by their previous head of the Nii Sackey family of Akpadebu. They averred that they had caused a site plan to be prepared which showed that the plaintiff's registered land falls far outside the defendants family land but the fact on the ground was that the plaintiff is physically on the defendants land and had trespassed. In a statement of defence that was subsequently filed, the defendants counter-claimed for declaration of title to a parcel of land measuring 180.93 acres, recovery of possession, damages for trespass and perpetual injunction.  In his Ruling the trial judge considered the submissions in the respective statements of case filed by the parties, the applicable principles and case law and concluded that he was satisfied that a case had been made for a grant of interlocutory injunction. However in order to safeguard the interests of the defendants and in accordance with Order 25 rule 9 of C.I. 47, he made the Order subject to an undertaking by the plaintiff to pay the defendants damages should it turn out at the final determination of the suit that the Order was not justified.  Dissatisfied with the decision, the defendants filed this Interlocutory appeal on 7th July 2014 seeking to set aside that Ruling. The grounds of appeal are:  1.The trial judge erred when he did not fully appreciate the defendants/appellants exhibit which showed that the plaintiff’s land was different from the defendants/appellants land.  2.The trial judge erred when he granted the motion for interlocutory injunction.  The defendants’ counsel argued the two grounds together in his written submissions. He referred to Vanderpuye vs. Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428, and Anaman vs. Osei Tutu \[1976\] 1 GLR 111 on the general principles and test for the grant of interim injunctions. He contended that the documents exhibited to the defendants’ affidavit in opposition including an official search Report at page 37 of the Record sufficiently showed that the land the plaintiff was claiming lay within the defendants Deed of Declaration whilst there was no recorded transaction of the plaintiff’s purported land. That the land being claimed by the plaintiff was different from plaintiff's land on her own site plan are not the same.  He submitted that on the authority of Anane vs Donkor \[1965\] GLR 188, a claim for declaration of title or an order for injunction must always fail if the plaintiff failed to establish positively the identity of the land claimed with the land the subject matter of the suit.  In his response plaintiff's counsel submitted that the trial judge had applied the correct principles and exercised his discretion properly in granting the interlocutory injunction. The court, taking note that the defendants had nothing on the land, had weighed the balance of convenience and the need to preserve the status quo. He relied on the following authorities:  \-Peterson vs. Charles Kusi \[2010\] 26 GMJ 83 at 85 C.A.  \-Odonkor vs. Amartei \[1987-1988\] 1 GLR 578 S.C.  \-Frimpong vs. Nana Asare Obeng ll \[1974\] 1 GLR 16  The guiding principle for the grant of interlocutory injunction as enacted in Order 25 rule 1 (1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004, C.I. 47 is that the Court may grant an injunction in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so. Although discretionary, there are settled principles for the grant of injunctions.  There are numerous authorities on the principles or tests that the court must apply in determining whether an applicant is entitled to the Order. Among the notable cases are Vanderpuye vs. Nartey \[supra\]and Pountney vs. Doegah \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 111. In both of these cases the Court of Appeal applied American Cyanamid Company vs. Ethicon Limited \[1975\] AC 396.These two cases held that the governing principle is whether on the face of the affidavits there is need to preserve the status quo in order to avoid irreparable damage to the applicant, provided his case was not frivolous or vexatious.  If a legal right could be asserted either at law or in equity, the court could grant an injunction in protection of that right. The rule does not require an applicant to establish a prima facie case. As was noted by Koranteng-Addow J in Musicians Union Of Ghana vs. Abraham \[1982-83\] 1 GLR 337, the courts have moved from the old stand of insisting on the applicant establishing a prima facie case, to a stand where the balance of convenience was the factor which (in a long measure) weighed most with the court, once the court was satisfied that the applicant's case was not frivolous and vexatious and also was one in which damages could not be an adequate alternative remedy.  Also as held by the Supreme Court in Odonkor vs. Amartei \[supra\] the basic purpose of interim orders was, as much as possible, to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them, and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was an empty one. It is granted where the violation of the right cannot be adequately compensated in damages at the end of the litigation  It is clear to see that the defendants counsel has misapprehended the ratio of the cases he cited in his submissions, especially the ratio in holding 2 of Vanderpuye vs. Nartey. That case did not uphold that an applicant must establish a prima facie case before he can be granted an interlocutory injunction, but rather the traditional view that the court must abstain from expressing an opinion upon the merits of the case until the hearing. What their Lordships said was this:  “The requirement that an applicant for interlocutory relief should show a prima facie case was apparently a recent development in the English courts as a manner for disposing of certain types of claim in Chancery. For the traditional view for the grant or refusal of interlocutory relief had been, for the court to abstain from expressing an opinion upon the merits of the case until the hearing, but to minimise the sum total of irreparable damage to the litigants.  Their Lordships were more direct in Pountney vs. Doegah. They stated clearly that there was no requirement for an applicant whose case was not frivolous; who had a legal or equitable right to be protected, to establish a prima facie case before the court could grant an injunction in protection of that right.  See also Owusu vs. Owusu \[2007-2008\] 1 SCGLR 870 where the Supreme Court per Adinyira JSC reiterated the need to avoid making a pronouncement on the merits of the case in an application for interlocutory injunction.  The conclusions of the defendants counsel that the land in dispute falls within the defendants land and the defendants have an iron clad case is therefore premature considering that the pleadings makes this one of the main issues in contention.  Clearly from the plaintiff's claim and the affidavits and exhibits filed in respect of the Motion, the plaintiff's case was not frivolous. She was asserting a right at law and to that end had exhibited a purported indenture made in 2004. It is worthy of note that the defendants registered Deed of Declaration was also purportedly made in 2004. However, as noted by the trial judge, the acquisition by the plaintiff's vendor was in 2001. The contention of the defendants that the plaintiff had not exhibited any recorded transaction in respect of the land is therefore not accurate.  The defendants also conceded that the plaintiff had commenced development on the land. This admitted fact called into play a consideration of the balance of convenience. In his Ruling the trial judge gave his reasons for the exercise of his discretion in plaintiff's favour. He considered the relative strengths of the parties’ cases and whether damages would afford adequate compensation. He applied those principals to the facts and circumstances of the case. He then considered whether it would be just and convenient to grant the order, cautioning himself of the need to avoid making a pronouncement on the merits of the case. His conclusion was that as between the parties it was the plaintiff who would suffer hardship as against the defendants whose main concern was the alleged unlawful invasion of their land  It is trite that judicial discretion cannot be fettered so long as it is exercised judicially in accordance with settled principles, having regard to the facts and the surrounding circumstances of each case and guided by principles of justice and fairness. There are no fixed rules for its exercise and each case must be decided on its own merits.  We are of the view that the application had merit and the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in granting the application. We have found no cause to interfere.  It is for the above reasons that the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.  (Sgd.)  CECILIA H. SOWAH  (JUSTICE OF APPEAL)  (Sgd.)  Adjei, J.A.I agree DENNIS ADJEI  (JUSTICE OF APPEAL)  (Sgd.)

"J U D G M E N T  ADJEI,J.A:  This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court Nkawkaw dated 28th February, 2013. The Plaintiffs/Respondents on their writ of summons claimed for seven reliefs including cost. They are as follows:  “a. Declaration that the termination of the Plaintiffs’ appointment with the Defendant hospital by medical superintendent was unfair and unlawful.  b. an order compelling the Defendant to pay compensation to each and every Plaintiff as a result of unfair termination of employment.  c. General damages for malicious prosecution.  d. General damages for defamation  e. Declaration that the deduction of monthly salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were paid into the Defendant’s accounts were unlawful.  f. An order disgorge the unjust profit/interest earned on the deductions made on the half salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were lodges in the Defendants’ account for over three years and same refunded to the affected Plaintiffs compelling the Defendant to herein.  g. An order for the payment of the salary arrears to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Plaintiffs which the Defendant has refused to pay despite several demands.  h. costs”.  The Plaintiffs abandoned reliefs (c) and (d) on the writ. The trial High Court Judge dismissed all the other reliefs and granted reliefs (b), (e), (f) and (g).  The Defendant appealed against the judgment of the trial High Court to this Court on 26th April, 2013. The two grounds of appeal filed by the Defendant are as follows:  “1. The judgment is against the weight of evidence on record.  2\. That the learned trial Judge was wrong when she held – “once the defendant assign a reason “unsatisfactory work performance” when the defendant assumed the burden of proving same on balance of probabilities. This, the defendant woefully failed to do” and that error occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice.”  I shall discuss the two grounds of appeal together as both of them require the Court to evaluate the entire evidence on record and come to the conclusion the trial Judge did not properly discuss either the facts or the law or both, and if the errors are corrected, the judgment should be overturned. Where there are evidence that the facts were not properly discussed and if they are properly discussed and evaluated the errors to be corrected, may overturn the judgment, the appeal should succeed.  On the other hand, where the errors are corrected and would not disturb the judgment, the appeal should fail. Where a court is setting aside a judgment, on the premise that the judgment is against the evidence on record, the court must satisfy itself that the mistakes to be corrected arising from the improper evaluation of the facts should be a genuine one and not fanciful errors.  In the case in point the Appellant’s concern is that the trial Judge held that an employer who terminates the employee’s employment is not required to assign reason but where he assigns reasons he should be able to justify it. The Defendant disagrees with the above statement made by the trial court which influenced its decision and the correct position of the law should be restated.  The trial Judge made the following reliefs after having discussed the evidence on record;  “In conclusion, this court makes the following orders:  1.The Defendant should pay each Plaintiff, except the eight, fifteen months salary as compensation or damages for wrongful termination or dismissal.  2.The Defendant is also to pay to each Plaintiff with the exception of the eight Plaintiffs, all entitlements if any under the contract of employment which were due or earned by the Plaintiffs but which remain unpaid by the Defendant.”  A look at the relief (1) granted by the trial court reveals that the trial Judge could not draw a distinction between wrongful termination and dismissal. The fifteen months salary as compensation was awarded by her for “wrongful termination or dismissal.”  There are difference among dismissal, wrongful termination and unfair termination and if the trial Judge should have used the terminologies correctly, she would have settled on what the compensation of fifteen months was meant for.  Dismissal is where an employee’s appointment has been truncated based on his behavior. Where the employee is dismissed contrary to the breach of the rule of natural justice or the collective agreement or a statute, he is said to have been unlawfully dismissed. A dismissal is an embarrassment as the employee loses most of his benefit. In the case of Aboagye vrs. Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd, \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 798where the employee was dismissed without a hearing it was held to constitute a wrongful dismissal. In other words, where disciplinary procedure rules provide that an employee should be heard irrespective of the offence, or the acts he commits, he should be heard. Employers are to ensure that disciplinary procedure rules are complied with to the letter.  A hearing in dismissal cases does not necessarily require the presence of the employee except where the disciplinary procedure rules provide that the employee should be physically present as in the case of Aboagye vrs. Ghana Commercial Bank (supra). In the case of Aryee vrs. State Construction Corporation \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 424, it was held that writing a letter to the employee to inform him about his misconduct or impropriety and asking him to respond in writing constituted a hearing.  In the case of dismissal, where the employee is not given a hearing or where he was dismissed contrary to the disciplinary procedure rules in that establishment, the dismissal would be held to be unlawful. For example, where a person is said to have stolen from his work place, he must be heard on the allegation of the impropriety before he could be dismissed. In a case where the administrative procedure rules requires that a person who absents himself from work for a week without an excuse should be suspended, an employee who absents himself from work for a week without excuse cannot be dismissed else it would flout the administrative procedure rules and the dismissal would amount to unlawful dismissal.  Termination on the other hand is not an embarrassment. The employee who is being terminated goes with all his benefits. An employer may terminate the employment of an employee without any reason provided the notice to be given or the salary in lieu of notice is in accordance with the Collective Agreement or the contract regulating their relationship. The employee too may terminate his employment with his employer without assigning any reason provided the notice given or the salary in lieu of notice paid is in accordance with the contract regulating their employment.  In the case of Bannerman-Menson vrs. Ghana Employers Association \[1996-97\] SCGLR 417 the Supreme Court held that either the employer or the employee may terminate his employment with his employer without assigning any reason and the employer could do the same thing. A termination is said to be unlawful where the parties who terminates the employment fails to give the required notice or salary in lieu of notice. In such a case, damages are awarded to compensate the injured party.  Unfair termination is where a party assigns a reason for the termination (even though he is not bound to give) and if he gives and is proved to be false, damages may be awarded. The burden of proof would be on the person who offered the reason and has proved to be false. Under the Labour Act, Section 63 has set out the grounds that may constitute unfair termination:  “63.1. The employment of a worker shall not be unfairly terminated by the worker’s employer.  2\. A worker’s employments is terminated unfairly if the only reason for the termination is :  a. that the worker has joined, intends to join or has ceased to be a member of a trade union or intends to take part in the activities of a trade union.  b. that the worker seeks office as, or is acting or has acted in the capacity of, a workers’ representative;  c. that the worker has filed a complaint or participated in proceedings against the employer involving alleged violation of this Act or any other enactment.  d. the worker’s gender, race, colour, ethnicity, origin, religion, creed, social, political or economic status;  e. in the case of a woman worker, due to the pregnancy of the worker or the absence of the worker from work during maternity leave;  f. in the case of a worker with a disability; due to the worker’s disability.  g. that the worker is temporarily ill or injured and this is certified by a recognized medical practitioner;  h. that the worker does not possess the current level of qualification required in relation to the work for which the worker was employed which is different from the level of qualification required at the commencement of the employment; or  i. that the worker refused or indicated an intention to refuse to do a work normally done by a worker who at the time was taking part in a lawful strike unless the work is necessary to prevent actual danger to life, personal safety or health or the maintenance of plant and equipment.  (3) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (2), a worker’s employment is deemed to be unfairly terminated if with or without notice to the employer, the worker terminates the contract of employment  a. because of ill-treatment of the worker by the employer, having regard to the circumstances of the case, or  b. because the employer has failed to take action on repeated complaints of sexual harassment of the worker at the workplace.  (4) A termination may be unfair if the employer fails to prove that  a. the reason for the termination is fair, or  b .the termination was made in accordance with a fair procedure or this Act  64\. Remedies for Unfair termination  (1) A worker who claims that the employment of the worker has been unfairly terminated by the worker’s employer may present a complaint to the Commission.  (2) If on investigation of the complaint the Commission finds that the termination of the employment is unfair, it may  a. order the employer to re-instate the worker from the date of the termination of employment.  b. order the employer to re-employ the worker, in the work for which the worker was employed before the termination or in any other reasonably suitable work on the same terms and conditions enjoyed by the worker before the termination; or  c. order the employer to pay compensation to the worker”.  From the above, one could have thought that section 63 was a statute applicable to all institutions but the Supreme Court in the Bani vrs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. \[2011\] 2 SCGLR 796, has categorically stated that it is only applicable to Labour Commission. This Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the termination was fair or unfair  Unfair termination is unknown to common law as an employee or employer complies with a contract or law regulating the employment but the reason he assigns is found to be false. In the case of Bani vrs. Maersk Ghana Ltd.(supra) the Supreme Court held:  “That unfair termination is not a common law principle and even though it was provided by the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) it was provided by the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) it was not meant to be applied by the Courts at the suit of a party to an employment contract”.  The Plaintiffs in this appeal neither sued for unlawful dismissal nor unlawful termination and there is no scintilla of evidence to support any of the two grounds. In the case of Dam vs. J.K. Addo Brothers \[1962) 2 GLR 200, the Supreme Court held that a court must not substitute a case proprio motu nor accept a case which is contrary to what he puts forward as his case. The grounds of the appeal succeed as there is no evidence on record to support unlawful dismissal or unlawful termination as concluded by the Judge.  The case of unfair termination should have been discussed by the trial Court as that was the case put forward by the Plaintiffs but this Court is bound by the ratio in the case of Bani vs. Maersk Ghana Limited \[2011\] (supra) where the Supreme Court unanimously held that the Courts do not have jurisdiction to entertain matters on unfair termination and the proper authority to handle such cases is the Labour Commission. Even though the Supreme Court quoted its earlier decision of Ashun vs. Accra Brewery Ltd. \[2009\] SCGLR 81, which purported to cloth the Courts with jurisdiction to entertain matters of unfair termination, it impliedly departed from it in the case ofBani vs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. (supra) and we are bound by it.  The appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court Nkawkaw on 28th February, 2013 is hereby set aside.  (SGD.)  DENNIS ADJEI  JUSTICE OF APPEAL  (SGD.)  SOWAH,J.A I also agree CECILIA SOWAH  JUSTICE OF APPEAL  AVRIL LOVELACE-JOHNSON (JA.)  The present appeal is against the judgment of the High Court delivered on 28th February 2013. By that judgment the Court had ordered the Defendant/Appellant to pay to each Plaintiff (except the 8th plaintiff) fifteen (15) months salary as compensation or damages for wrongful termination or dismissal all entitlements due them under their contract of employments which remained unpaid and costs of GH₵ 2,000.00.  Being dissatisfied with the said judgment the Defendants/Appellants appeal to this Court for its reversal on the following grounds:  “(i) That the judgment is against the weight of evidence.  (ii)That the learned trial judge was wrong when she held that –once the defendants assign a reason “unsatisfactory work performance” then the defendant assumed the burden of proving same on balance of probabilities. This is the defendant woefully fails to do, “and that error occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice” (sic).  (iii)That the learned trial judge erred in law by relying on a burden of proof other than the standard required in civil cases and that resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  (iv)That the meaning assigned to the phrase “unsatisfactory performance” by the learned trial judge is over exaggerated beyond their dictionary meaning and wrongfully applied that meaning in her judgment that has occasioned a miscarriage of justice (sic).  (v)That the respondent completely failed to proved their claimed that the termination of their appointments were unfair and unlawful as the court rightly found (sic)”.  The Plaintiffs had by the writ of summons sought the following reliefs:  “(a) Declaration that the termination of the Plaintiffs’ appointments with the Defendant hospital by medical superintendent was unfair and unlawful.  b)An order compelling the defendant to pay compensation to each and every Plaintiff as a result of unfair termination of employment.  c)General damages for malicious prosecution.  d)General damages for defamation.  e)Declaration that the deduction of monthly salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were paid into the Defendant’s account was unlawful.  f)An order to disgorge the unjust profit/interest earned on the deductions made on the half salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were lodged in the Defendant’s account for over three years and same refunded to the affected Plaintiffs compelling the Defendant to herein.  g)An order for the payment of the salary arrears to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Plaintiffs which the Defendant has refused to pay despite several demands.  h)Costs”.  The parties will be referred to by designations used in the High Court.  The case of the Plaintiffs in the High Court as per evidence given on their behalf by two of their members was that after being accused by a committee set up by the Defendants for stealing, they were arraigned before the Circuit Court on a charges of stealing. They were acquitted and discharged after trial. Prior to this, they were interdicted and put on half of their salaries. Their position was that their prosecution had been initiated by the Defendants. They pointed out that having worked satisfactorily for the Defendants, as evidenced by their various promotions and awards, the termination of their appointment was unfair and unlawful.  The position of the Defendants on the other hand was that as a result of the Plaintiff tampering with the computer system at the hospital the latter lost money. The plaintiffs were interdicted and after an audit investigation, the matter was referred to the police who after their own investigation charged them with the offence of stealing. Upon their acquittal, the plaintiffs’ appointments were terminated and all entitlements due them paid to them. Their termination was on the grounds that their services were unsatisfactory.  Now to the grounds of appeal  I wish to first deal with concerns raised by counsel for Plaintiffs, regarding grounds III and IV of the grounds of appeal earlier listed.  In respect of grounds III, counsel contends that it sins against Rule 8(4) of The Court of Appeal Rules 1997 CI 19. By this an appellant who alleges misdirection or error in law is required to state clearly the particulars of such misdirection or error.  In the case of ground IV, counsel again contends that it sins against Rule 8(6) because it is vague.  I have looked at both grounds and I am satisfied that ground III does provide sufficient particulars of the alleged error which is that the learned trial Judge used a burden of proof other than that required in a civil case. Ground IV, while being verbose can certainly not be said to be vague.  No submissions were made on the first two grounds of appeal. They are deemed to have been abandoned.  Grounds iii, iv & v can conveniently be taken together. The fifth ground of appeal is that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their termination were unfair and unlawful. On this ground Counsel for the Defendants submits that immediately the Court determined that the defendants terminated the employment of the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of their contract of employment and so found the termination lawful, the court should have dismissed the case of the plaintiffs.  The position of the counsel for the Plaintiffs appears to be that the finding of the court that the termination was lawful did not necessarily mean it was fair. Counsel cites Sections 62 and 63 (4) of the Labour Act, 2003, Act 251 and states that the plaintiffs termination of employment was most unfair. He also cites the case of Kobi and others vs. Ghana Manganese Co. Ltd. (2007-2008) SCGLR at 794.  Is the complaint of Counsel for the Defendant borne out by the record and the law?  Exhibits A1 – A7 are the termination letters of the Plaintiffs. In each of them no reason was given for the termination. Each letter also stated that the worker was entitled to one month’s salary in lieu of notice. Exhibit D, the collective agreement governing the working relationship between the parties states in Article 28 that each party to the agreement is to give the other one month’s notice or one month’s payment in lieu of such notice excepting summary dismissal.  It is obvious then that there is no need to give a reason for termination under this Article. The letter of termination given to the plaintiffs clearly satisfied the conditions stated therein. In the said letters the only reasons given were that management could not work with the plaintiffs. On the face of it then, the termination of the plaintiff was in accordance with the terms of Exhibit D. To the trial Court, this made the said termination lawful.  If the plaintiffs had not issued the present writ, that would have been the end of the matter but the present writ was issued. The trial Court took the position that once the Defendants gave a reason other than a right to terminate in their statement of defence they became duty bound to prove this defence. The defence was that the plaintiffs’ work performance was unsatisfactory and this according to the court they failed to prove on the balance of probabilities.  The question to be answered at this stage is whether it was proper for the trial court to expect the defendants to discharge any burden of proof after having found that the termination was lawful on the face of it because it was done in accordance with Exhibit D, the CBA.  In the Supreme Court case of Kobi Vs. Ghana Manganese Co. Ltd. 2007-2008 2 SCGLR 771 the Supreme Court in deciding an appeal on a claim for damages for wrongful termination of appointment stated the traditional rule that an employer was at liberty in dispensing with the services of an employee to give or refuse to give reasons once its done in accordance with the contract of service (Aryee vs. State Construction Corporation (1984-86) 1 GLR 424). The Court per Ansah JSC further stated that  “in seeking to exercise the right to give or not to give reasons, fairness must be the watch word. Every allegation of misconduct ought to be proved” .  While this case was not one for declaration by the plaintiffs that their termination was unfair or damages for same, the court referred to what constituted unfair termination of employment under the Labour Act and stated that the fact that all due entitlements have been paid does not necessarily mean a termination is fair even when the employer (as in the present case) has power to terminate the employment in accordance with the CBA.  The answer to the question earlier posed then is that, yes, having alleged “wrong doing” on the part of the Plaintiffs it was proper for the court to require the Defendants to prove this allegation inspite of the finding that the termination had been ‘lawfully’ done in accordance with Exhibit D, the CBA  On this issue the learned Trial Judge delivered herself as follows at page 42 of the record of appeal:  “once the defendant made the assertion that it terminated the plaintiff’s appointment because of unsatisfactory conduct or performance then the onus was on the defendant to prove the unsatisfactory conduct of the plaintiff. However the defendant failed to discharge this burden. It could not even convince the trial criminal court that the plaintiff had indeed stolen its money and in this court too, the defendant could not tell what precisely the plaintiffs did that enabled them to manipulate its computer system to steal money belonging to the defendant. The defendant could also could also not tell what amount each individual plaintiff stole. It could not even tender in evidence copies of the alleged queries it issued to the plaintiffs for their unsatisfactory conduct. This court thus cannot make a finding of fact that the plaintiffs appointments were terminated because of their unsatisfactory performance or conduct”.  The summary of the evidence of the Defendants’ Representative earlier given in this judgment indeed confirms the learned trial Judge’s position. From counsel for Defendants submissions, he appears to be saying that once it was established that the loss of GH₵ 44,000 took place at a place where the plaintiffs exclusively worked and that they were the only ones who operated the computers then the Defendants had been able to successfully prove that the work of the plaintiffs was unsatisfactory.  All this by itself without more cannot be said to be sufficient proof on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiffs work was unsatisfactory. The fact that the trial court referred to the defendants failure to prove the plaintiffs guilt in the criminal court does not mean she applied the standard of proof in criminal cases to the present case as alleged in the third ground of appeal.  Without doubt they failed to discharge the burden of proof required in civil cases.  This failure to discharge the evidential burden imposed on them by law is not a result of the trial court giving an exaggerated meaning to the phrase “unsatisfactory performance” as claimed in the fourth ground of appeal. What was required was not a dictionary meaning of the phrase in question as counsel for Defendants seems to imply but proof of their assertion. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the court’s finding that the evidence led was not sufficient proof of this allegation since this conclusion is borne out by the evidence led.  In its judgment the court made reference to section 62 of the Labour Act of 2003, Act 651. It is sufficient only to state that the case of Bani vs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. 2011 2 SCGLR is authority for the proposition that the provisions of sections 62 & 63 of the said Act are directed at the Labour Commission and not the Courts and that the recourse of a person who complains of unfair termination is not a claim for damages before the courts but a complaint before the Labour Commission.  On the basis of this my esteemed brother and sister take the position that the trial Court “lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the termination was fair or unfair”. It is clear from page 150 of the Record of Appeal that the Judge was in no doubt that she had no jurisdiction to make such a determination. The present action was not decided under the provisions of Act 651 despite the Judge’s reference to its provisions.  Her conclusion that the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs was wrongful and unfair was because she took the position that the Defendants, having failed to prove the alleged unsatisfactory work performance and the plaintiffs having on the other hand led evidence of satisfactory work by tendering promotion letters, best worker award, etc. the balance of probabilities favoured the latter.  What are the consequences of the finding that the balance of possibilities favour the plaintiffs? I am satisfied that this finding means that the evidence supports a case of wrongful termination. As already stated the plaintiffs had sought damages for unfair termination – (an award the trial court would not have had jurisdiction to make) what the court awarded was damages for wrongful termination or dismissal. See page 155 of the Record of Appeal.  A reference has been made to the case of DAM VS. J.K. ADDO BROTHERS (1962) 2 GLR 2000where the Supreme Court held that a court must not substitute a case or accept a case which is contrary to what a party has put forward.  I am satisfied from the evidence that the case put forward by the plaintiffs is one of wrongful termination of appointment. That being so are the plaintiffs to be denied recompense because they make a claim for compensation for unfair termination of employment rather than seeking to be compensated for wrongful termination?  I think not. This is a Court of law as well as equity. It also exercises its jurisdiction “by way of rehearing”. The courts go to extreme lengths to do justice rather than insisting on form. In the light of the position taken by the Supreme Court in the case of Hana Assi (No.2) vs. Gihoc Refrigeration (2007-2008) SCGLR 16 that where a judicial relief is clearly established by the evidence led by a defendant, the proper and fair thing to do will be to grant him the said relief, I feel no hesitation in changing the damages awarded by the trial court for “wrongful termination or dismissal” to damages for wrongful termination.  Admittedly that case dealt with the question of whether a defendant who had not filed a counterclaim deserved a judicial relief supported by her evidence.  I see no reason why a plaintiff should not be entitled to the same consideration. Interestingly there is no appeal by the defendants against the damages awarded in this case.  I am satisfied that the plaintiffs were entitled to the said damages.  In conclusion, I find no merit in the three grounds of appeal canvassed by the Appellant to warrant the reversal of the decision of the High court. The appeal is dismissed in its entirety.  (SGD.)

"J U D G M E N T  HENRY A. KWOFIE JA:  This is an appeal against the ruling of the High Court (General Jurisdiction) Accra dated 3rd of December 2018. By a Writ of Summons and a statement of claim filed on the 24th of May 2018, the plaintiff which is a company limited by guarantee claimed against the defendants the following reliefs:  a)A declaration that the 1st defendant is not the company secretary of the plaintiff’s company  b)A declaration that the 1st to 7th, defendants are neither subscribers nor executive council member of the plaintiff company.  c)An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st – 7th defendants from holding themselves out as subscribing members and executive members of the plaintiff company  d)An order directed at the 10th defendant from interfering with or altering the records of the plaintiff company without the knowledge consent and authorization of the foundational members and directors as the case may require per the regulations of the Company Act  e)An order compelling the 8th and 9th defendant to allow the plaintiff company to have access to its accounts  f)Damages awarded against the 8th and 9th defendants for breach of contract.  g)Costs involving solicitors fees  h)Any order(s) which the honourable Court in the circumstances may deem fit.  The plaintiff/appellant on the same day 24th May 2018 filed an application for an order of interlocutory injunction praying the Court for the following interim orders:  a)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th defendants/respondents from holding themselves out as subscribing members and executive council members of the applicant company  b)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st respondent from holding himself out as company secretary of the applicant company  c)An order for interlocutory injunction compelling the 8th and 9th respondents to allow the applicant company to have access to its accounts;  d)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 10th respondent from interfering with or altering the records of the plaintiff company without the knowledge consent and authorization of the foundational members and directors as the case may require per the regulations of the Companies Act.  The 1st to 7th defendants also filed an application for interlocutory injunction on 13th July 2018 and subsequently on 17th July 2018 filed their statement of defence and counterclaim. In their application for interlocutory injunction, the 1st to 7th defendnats prayed the Court for an order of interlocutory injunction to restrain the plaintiff and any other persons acting on its behalf, their assigns, agents, and privies from operating any bank account of the plaintiff company held at the 8th and 9th defendant banks until the final determination of the action and for such further and other orders as to this honourable court may deem it fit.  In their statement of defence the 1st to 7th defendants denied the plaintiff’s claim and counterclaimed as follows against the plaintiff:  i)A declaration that the 2nd to 5th defendants to the counterclaim are not directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim.  ii) An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd to 5th  defendants to the counterclaim from carrying themselves out as directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim.  iii) An order directed at the 8th and 9th defendants in the main action from honoring any cheques or other financial instruments presented to them by the 2nd to 5th defendants to the counterclaim.  iv) Costs including legal costs.  The trial judge heard the 2 applications at the same time and in his ruling delivered on 3rd December 2018 dismissed the 2 applications. He however ordered as follows:  “ Order 25 rule 1(1) empowers the court in dealing with an application for an order of interlocutory injunction to make an order “either unconditionally or upon such terms as the court considers just”. Duly informed and fortified by Order 25, rule 1(1) I believe the circumstances dictate and enforce that the rights and privileges of the parties be controlled, regulated or otherwise limited, in a way, pending the final trial and determination of the substantive action. Accordingly I order, that pending the final trial and determination of this suit and starting from today both parties being the plaintiff and the 1st to 7th respondents are hereby restrained from making orders to 8th and 9th respondents to release funds to them”  Dissatisfied with this ruling the plaintiff company filed an interlocutory appeal against the said ruling on the following grounds:  a)That the ruling is against the weight of evidence  b)The learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that restraining the appellant from having access to its funds would not only lead to the collapse of the appellant, but also result in the breach of various statutory obligations by the appellant.  c)That the learned trial judge in exercising his discretionary power completely misapprehended the facts of the instant suit when he held that from the pleadings, some of the respondents the 1st respondent in particular, appears to be a member of the appellant notwithstanding the fact that the respondents in their statement of defence had denied being members of the appellant.  d)That the learned trial judge, in exercising his discretionary power failed to apply the settled principles that govern the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction when he restrained the appellant notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had demonstrated that it had a prima facie legal right over the respondents which ought to be protected  e)That the learned trial judge in exercising his discretionary power failed to apply the settled principles that govern the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction when he failed to consider the irreparable damage and inconvenience the appellant stood to suffer, which said damage cannot be compensated in damages, but rather deferred for determination at the trial  f)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that the respondents did not stand to suffer any irreparable damage in the unlikely event that the trial court holds upon determination of the substantive suit that they are directors of the appellant  g)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that per the regulations of the appellant, which is a company limited by guarantee, the liability of the members are limited to the sum of Five Hundred Ghana Cedis (GH�500) and therefore even if the trial court were to hold at the end of the trial that the respondents were members of the appellant any loss to be suffered would not be irreparable  h)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when notwithstanding his earlier ruling dated 13th July 2018 in which he held that the instant suit was not a derivative action, proceeded to treat the appellants application for injunction as a competing claim between two sets of people claiming to be directors and/or subscribers of the appellant  i)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he disregarded certified records from the Registrar General’s department which confirmed that Titus Tei, Prof Binka and Stephen Tollman are the members and directors of the appellant.  j)Further grounds will be settled as necessary upon receipt of the record of proceedings.  The ruling the subject of appeal can be found at pages 336 to 354 of the Record of Appeal. The reliefs sought from the Court of Appeal are:  a)That the entire ruling be set aside  b)That the respondents pending the determination of the instant suit, be restrained per the terms of the application for injunction filed at the trial Court and dated May 24, 2018  c)Such further orders as this honourable Court may deem fit.  Counsel for the appellant in his written submissions abandoned grounds (a) of the grounds of appeal and accordingly ground (a) is hereby struck out as abandoned.  Arguing these grounds of appeal, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in considering both applications for interlocutory injunction, the discretion exercised by the trial judge as represented by the orders he made was made on a wrong or inadequate materials and further that in considering both applications the learned trial judge ought to have concluded that the plaintiff company had demonstrated a prima facie legal right to be protected whereas the 1st to 7th respondents had woefully failed to establish any such right. He submitted that the plaintiff was incorporated by Prof. Fred Binka, Titus Tei and Stephen Tollman who have at all times remained the subscribing members of the plaintiff company and he referred to section 30(6) of the Companies Act 1963 Act 179 to buttress his point. He also referred to the Regulations of the Company which revealed that these three persons are the first directors of the Company. He submitted that the trial judge’s finding that there was a contest over the heart and soul of the Company amounted to a misapprehension of the facts. He referred to the case of 18th July Limited Vrs. Yehans International Ltd. (2012) SCGLR 167 and Vanderpuye Vs. Nartey (1977) GLR 428 and submitted that plaintiff has a legal right which the court ought to have protected. Counsel also referred to Exhibit DKB3, the Regulations attached to defendant’s affidavit in opposition and submitted that the said Exhibit is contrary to Sections 162 and 175 of the Evidence Act 1975 (NRCD323) which requires an authentication of a copy of a document in official custody in this case the Registrar Generals Department.  Responding to the arguments of counsel for the plaintiff counsel for the 1st to 7th defendants submitted that the main action before the Court was initiated in the name of the plaintiff without the consent, instruction or authorization or any resolution from the 1st to 7th respondents, though they are the right people to consent or authorize the taking of any action including having access to plaintiff’s account and initiation of legal action on behalf of the plaintiff. Counsel submitted that it is not in dispute that the appellant exists as a company limited by guarantee and that a company as a legal personality acts through physical persons. The issue according to counsel, is who are the rightful persons to exercise the powers of the plaintiff Company. Counsel submitted that this issue remains at large until the final determination of the suit and therefore the ruling of the court below is apt as it ensures that the donor funds received by the plaintiff are expanded by the rightful parties absence of which the project funds are better kept intact and accounted for to the appropriate donors.  Looking at the grounds of appeal, they all relate to the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion and raise the issue of whether the trial judge exercised his discretion judiciously or capriciously.  Order 25 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (C.I.47) governs the determination of an application for interlocutory injunction. Order 25 rule 1(1) provides as follows:  “ (1) The court may grant an injunction by an interlocutory  Order in all cases in which it appears to be just or convenient to do so, and the order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers fit”.  In the case of Owusu vs. Owusu Ansah & Another (2007-2008) SCGLR 870 in headnote 1, the Supreme Court discussed the grounds upon which an injunction may be granted as follows:  “ The fundamental principle in application for interim  application is whether the applicant has a right at Law or in equity which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits”.  Also in the case of 18th July Ltd. Vs. Yehans International Ltd (2012) SCGLR 167 the Supreme Court per Anin Yeboah J.S.C. (as he then was) after analyzing cases likeVanderpuye Vs Nartey (1977) GLR 428 and Odonkor Vs. Amatei (1987-1988) GLR 578 stated as follows:  “ We are of the opinion that the Court of Appeal did not  propose to lay down any hard and fast rule or principles to regulate the determination of interlocutory injunctions. Even though it is discretionary, we are of the view that a trial court in determining interlocutory applications must first consider whether the case of the applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had a legal or equitable right which a Court should protect. Second, the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardship to the other party”.  From the provision of Order 25 rule 1 and the authorities, an injunction is a discretionary relief and a court or judge in determining an application for injunction must exercise his discretion judiciously and not capriciously or arbitrarily. The court must also determine whether the applicant has demonstrated that he has a right at law or in equity to be protected. The court must also consider the balance of convenience whilst maintaining the status quo.  The evidence shows that the plaintiff Company is a company limited by guarantee and the law is settled that even though a company has a legal personality and exists independently of its members, it acts through individuals ie physical persons, usually through its members in general meetings or its board of directors or officers as set out in section 137(1) to (5) of the Companies Act 1963 (Act 179) which provide as follows:  1)A company shall act through its members in general  meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by or under authority derived from the members in general meetings or board of directors.  2)Subject to the provisions of this code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company’s Regulations  3)Except as otherwise provided in the Company’s Regulations the business of the Company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting.  4)Notwithstanding the provisions of sub section (3) of this section the members in general meeting may  a)Act in any matter if the members of the board of directors are disqualified or unable to act by reason of a deadlock on the board or otherwise  b)Institute legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company if the board of directors refuse or neglect to do so  c)Ratify or confirm any action taken by the board of directors, or  d)Make recommendations to the board of directors regarding action to be taken by the board.  5)No alteration of the Regulations shall invalidate any prior act of the board of directors which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made”.  Looking at the reliefs being sought by the plaintiff in this action and those being sought by the 1st to 7th defendants in their counterclaim, it is obvious that the real and fundamental issue for determination in the suit at the trial court is the issue of who are the rightful persons to exercise the power of the plaintiff Company that is to say is it the persons who instituted the action using the name of the plaintiff Company or the 1st to 7th defendants? There is as a corollary to this issue, the question of who are the rightful person to have control and access to the plaintiff Company’s funds being held by the 8th and 9th defendants ie Republic Bank and GT Bank. The trial judge in my view correctly fixed his sights on that issue when he stated in his ruling as follows at page 325 of the Record thus:  “Now having regard to the competing claims of the parties and given the affidavit evidence and facts of the case it is clear that the respective cases have a single strand running through them and it is who has the right to control the heart and soul of the company called Indepth Network.  After considering the allegations and counter allegations of forgery and illegality levelled by the parties against each other and after considering the issue of whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable damage and inconvenience if the application is refused, the trial judge again stated as follows:  “ As noted earlier on, who has the right to control the  plaintiff Company is the centerpiece of this litigation and therefore this Court ought to avoid making any definite findings at this moment in time. With that in mind and on the balance of convenience, I hold that it shall not be just and convenient to grant either the plaintiffs request for an injunctive order nor that of the 1st to 7th defendants application ……….. Order 25 rule 1(1) empowers the Court in dealing with an application for an order of interlocutory injunction to make an order either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers just …… Accordingly, I order that pending the final trial and determination of this suit and starting from today, both parties being the plaintiff and 1st to 7th Respondents are hereby restrained from making orders to the 8th and 9th Respondents to release funds to them”  The trial judge then made an order for a timely and speedy adjudication of the matter by ordering the plaintiff to file a reply if need be and take out application for Directions within 14 days for the case to proceed to an early trial.  It is this decision of the trial judge that is the subject of this appeal and the plaintiff/appellant has in all the grounds of appeal and the written submissions attacked the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion. It is worth pointing out that the funds which the parties are fighting over are donor funds. The record of appeal shows that the plaintiff company Indepth Network receives funds from donors to undertake its activities. For example at page 158 of the Record of Appeal, an entity called Charity Projects (Comic Relief) approved a grant of �814, 035.00 to Indepth Network, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also approved a grant of over $2,250, 032.00 to Indepth Network (page 188 to 192 of the Record) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also gave an amount not exceeding �1, 038,305. These indeed are substantial amounts!  In respect of all the grounds of appeal the plaintiff takes issue with the manner in which the trial judge exercised his discretion.  In the case of Blunt Vs. Blunt (1943) AC517 at 518 H.L. Viscount Simon stated the established rule of law in an appeal against the exercise of the Courts discretion as follows:  “ An appeal against the exercise of the courts discretion can only succeed on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials if it can be shown that the court acted under a misapprehension of fact in that it either gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into account; but the appeal is not from the discretion of the court to the discretion of the appellate court”  This decision in Blunt Vs. Blunt (supra) was applied in the case of Crentstil Vs. Crentsil (1962) 2 GLR 171 at 175 where the Supreme Court held per Sarkodie Addo JSC that:  “As to appeals from the exercise of the courts discretion, it is a rule of law deep-rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of the Court’s discretion save in exceptional circumstances”.  Also in the case of Sappor Vs. Wigatap Ltd (2007-2008) 1 SCGLR 676 at 677 the Supreme Court held as follows in holding 2 thereof thus:  “ The well known and time honoured legal principle is that  an appeal against a decision based on the exercise of a court’s discretionary jurisdiction, would succeed in only those clearly exceptional cases where in sum the judge failed to act judicially. The applicable principles are; an appellate court would interfere with the exercise of the discretion where the court below applied wrong principles or the conclusions reached would work manifest injustice or even that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate material. Arbitrary, capricious and uninformed conclusions stand in danger of being reversed on appeal”  The fundamental question for determination in this appeal is whether the appellant succeeded in establishing all the factors necessary to prove that the trial Court exercised its discretion wrongly. We are of the view that having gone through the record of appeal and the written submissions of counsel, that the trial judge exercised his discretion properly and took into consideration all the relevant matters and came to the correct conclusions. Before we are done we must refer to relief (f) of the plaintiff’s claim wherein it asked for  “ (f) An order compelling the 8th and 9th defendants to allow  the plaintiff company to have access to its accounts”.  In the application for an order of interlocutory injunction, dated 7th June 2018 the plaintiff sought amongst the interim reliefs,  “(e) An order of mandatory injunction compelling the 8th and  9th defendants to allow the plaintiff Company to have access to its accounts”  Clearly if the trial judge had granted interim relief (e), that would have amounted to a determination of relief (f) as endorsed on the plaintiffs writ of summons. That in our view would have been improper having regard to the issues to be determined in the substantive suit.  On the whole we find no merit in the plaintiff appeal and same is dismissed in its entirety.  SGD  JUSTICE HENRY A. KWOFIE  (JUSTICE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL)  SGD  I ALSO AGREE ……………………..

"JUDGMENT  DR. DATE-BAH JSC:This case calls for resort to the basic analytical tools for determining the formation of contracts, including offer, invitation to treat, acceptance and intention to create legal relations, which are to be found set out in the earlier chapters of textbooks, and practice books, on the law of contract. To our mind, the outcome from the application of those tools is clear and self-evident. We are, thus, surprised that this case has had to travel this far for its resolution.  The plaintiff at one time worked for the defendant as head of its Legal Department. Whilst still in its employment, she received the following letter from the defendant.  “17 January 2005  Ms. Yaa Antwi  NTHC Limited  ACCRA  Dear Madam  OFFER FOR SALE – HOUSE NO. 4 PLATEAU CLOSE  EAST LEGON EXTENSION  The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff.  In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.  If you are interested, you are to indicate, in writing, to the undersigned by Monday, 31 January 2005.  Yours faithfully  Gladys A. Odoi (Ms)  Board Secretary  Cc Managing Director”  The plaintiff, in reply to this letter, stated in a letter dated 31st January, 2005 that:  “I refer to the offer by the Board to sell the above-referenced house to me as contained in your letter of January 17, 2005 referenced NTHC/ADMI/GEN/.  I accept the offer to purchase House No. 4 Plateau Close at the cost price of US $ 70,307 or its cedis equivalent and to make payment within the stipulated 6 months.  It would be greatly appreciated if details of bank accounts into which payment may be made are provided for the benefit of the house loan company.”  There was no further correspondence between the parties until the dispatch of the following letter, dated 7th November, 2005 by the defendant to the plaintiff:  “Dear Ms. Antwi  RE: OFFER FOR SALE – HOUSE NO 4 PLATEAU CLOSE, EAST LEGON  I am directed by the Board Chairman to inform you that, as was previously communicated to you following extensive deliberations on the above matter, the Board of Directors have decided to withdraw the offer for sale of the said property to enable the Company house its new management staff.  Any inconvenience is very much regretted.”  This letter was signed on behalf of the defendant by its Deputy Managing Director.  In the meantime, the plaintiff had left the employment of the defendant and had begun working for a different employer from 8th August, 2005. This fact was relied upon by the defendant in its next letter to the plaintiff, dated 10th November, 2005, which sought to require the plaintiff to vacate the house in dispute. The letter advised the plaintiff to vacate the house, following her resignation from the employment of the defendant.  On these facts, the plaintiff brought action against the defendant, claiming that the exchange of letters in January 2005 resulted in an agreement that the defendant would sell to the plaintiff House No. 4 Plateau Close, East Legon Extension for the sum of US $ 70,307 or its equivalent in cedis and that the plaintiff would pay the purchase price within 6 months of the offer. She averred that though she had requested of the defendant the particulars of the bank account into which to pay the purchase price of the property, the defendant had neglected to furnish such particulars. The plaintiff sought specific performance of the agreement made in January 2005 and a perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant from ejecting the plaintiff from the property.  The defence proferred by the defendant was that its letter of 17th January 2005 was not an offer, but, according to its statement of defence, “only an invitation to staff to make offers to purchase the premises, the final decisions on the matter rested with Defendant”. The defendant thus denied the existence of any enforceable agreement between the parties.  The main issue in this case, therefore, hinges on the interpretation to be put on the letter of 17th January, in its context. Was the letter an offer or a mere invitation to treat? The learned trial judge, Ofoe J., as he then was, considered the letter to be a mere invitation to treat. In his judgment, he laid emphasis on the use of the word “proposed” in relation to “sell” and thus persuaded himself that the company’s proposal to sell was not a definite enough offer of the property to the plaintiff. He therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s action, holding that no contract had been formed. Ofoe J. explained his decision thus (at p. 86 of the Record):  “The letter provides that at the Board Meeting the Board “proposed to sell the company’s houses”. I have no reason for interpreting the word proposed other than what it is and what it means. The last paragraph also provides:  “If you are interested, you are to indicate in writing to the undersigned by Monday 31st January, 2005.”  Can it be said that this last paragraph read together with other paragraphs in Exhibit A, Exhibit A was a firm offer of the property to the plaintiff? I think not. It is my view that Exhibit A even though the word “offer” is used, was initiating negotiations with the staff on the proposal of the defendant to dispose of their properties. The request for plaintiff to show interest in the property I see it as asking the plaintiff rather to make the offer. It is my view that plaintiff’s response declaring her interest as she did in Exhibit B cannot be an acceptance of an offer by the defendant but rather offering for the defendant’s acceptance her interest in the purchase of the property.”  On appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of the trial court was reversed. The Court of Appeal, in a judgment written by Marful-Sau JA, arrived at the conclusion that the letter of 17th January contained an offer. The learned judge expressed himself thus (at p. 129 of the Record):  “From the way Exhibit A is written and its content as a whole, I am satisfied that it qualifies to be an offer properly called in contract. The letter was not conducting any enquiry. It is clear from the body that a specific house, House No. 4 Plateau Close, East Legon Extension was offered to Appellant to purchase at a quoted price and to be paid within six months. The letter only requested the Appellant to indicate her interest as to whether she accept the terms offered in Exhibit A or not.”  We are, in this court, called upon to determine which of the two lower courts was right in its interpretation of the letter of 17th January. The grounds of appeal filed by the defendant in this court against the Court of Appeal’s decision are as follows:  “a. The Court of Appeal erred when it held that Exhibit A and Exhibit B amounted to a contract.  b.The Court of Appeal erred when it decreed an Order of Specific Performance in the circumstances of this case.  c.The Court of Appeal erred when it ordered Appellant to refund to Respondent all rents paid by the Respondent to Appellant.  d.Further and/or in the alternative the Court of Appeal erred when it retrospectively decreed specific performance of the contract without awarding Plaintiff interest on the purchase price of $70,307.00”  Before resolving the issue of interpretation raised in ground (a), however, it would be useful to remind ourselves, in outline, of the principles to be applied in distinguishing between offers and invitations to treat.  Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.  It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer. Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms. Thus Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition, 1999) Vol. 1 para. 2-007 at p. 93 states that:  “A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called an invitation to treat. It is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that it is not made with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as the person to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms.”  A case relied on by the appellant, Gibson v Manchester City Council \[1979\] 1 All ER 972, is illustrative of a communication during “negotiations” which was not definite and final enough to be treated as an offer and therefore was rightly categorized as an invitation to treat. The case involved the tenant of a council house in Manchester, England, who wanted to buy the house from the council. In the middle of the process for the purchase of the property, following local government elections in May 1971, the local council changed its policy and decided not to proceed with the sale of any house in respect of which there had not yet been an exchange of contracts. The correspondence between the tenant and the council before this reversal of policy was as follows:  After the city council had adopted a policy of selling houses to its tenants, the City Treasurer, following a request made by the tenant in this case for details of the price of the house he was renting and the mortgage terms available, had written on 10th February 1971 to the tenant stating that the council “may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price 2,725 pounds less 20% - 2,180 pounds (freehold).” The letter then set out the mortgage terms likely to be made available and continued:  “If you would like to make formal application to buy your Council house please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible.”  Accordingly, the tenant duly completed an application form with the heading “Application to buy a council house”, except that he did not fill in the purchase price, and returned it to the council. The form concluded with the statement: “I…now wish to purchase my Council house. The above answers are correct and I agree that they shall be the basis of the arrangements regarding the purchase…” The tenant followed up his application form a few days later with a letter dated 18th March 1971 in which he said: “I would be obliged if you will carry on with the purchase as per my application already in your possession.” Before contracts for the house could be exchanged, the May elections intervened which led to the reversal of the council’s policy on sales of houses to tenants, to which we have already alluded. The council subsequently wrote to the tenant to advise him that his application for a purchase of a council house could not be processed any further. When the tenant contended that the City Treasurer’s letter of February 1971 was an offer and that his completed application form of March 1971 was an acceptance and he therefore brought action for specific performance of the contract, the House of Lords held that the City Treasurer’s letter was at most an invitation to treat and that it was the tenant’s application form which was rather the offer. Lord Russell of Killowen declared (at p. 980) that:  “My Lords, I cannot bring myself to accept that a letter which says that the possible vendor ‘May be prepared to sell the house to you’ can be regarded as an offer to sell capable of acceptance so as to constitute a contract. The language simply does not permit such a construction.”  We do not agree with the defendant/respondent/appellant in this case when it asserts in its Statement of Case (paragraph 10) that its case is on all fours with the Gibson case. There is no question that the City Treasurer’s letter lacked finality. It could not be turned into a contract by mere acceptance. There were still significant terms which needed to be agreed upon. This is in marked contrast with the facts of this case where the letter from the defendant/respondent/appellant proposed the sale to the plaintiff of an identified property at a price certain. What was left to be communicated were the details of the bank account into which the price was to be paid. This was a subsidiary question which did not affect the finality of what we construe to be the offer contained in the letter.  The appellant also strenuously sought to make a distinction between the language construed to be an offer in Fofie v Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 and the language in the present case. This contention was in rebuttal of the view taken by the Court of Appeal that the decision in the Fofie case should lead to the letter of 17 th January 2005 being construed as an offer. Marful-Sau JA had said in the court below, after quoting the text of the offer in the Fofie case, that:  “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer. The above letter suggested that should the offeree indicate his acceptance, a further meeting was to be held, yet the Supreme Court affirmed the holding by both the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal that it was a valid offer.”  In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms:  “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.”  The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer. The disagreement in that case between the Court of Appeal and the trial judge was as to whether there had been any acceptance of this offer. The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter. The appellant’s argument is set out as follows in its Statement of Case (para. 14):  “The said Exhibit B was thus written in furtherance of the earlier discussions between the parties and was only to formalize the earlier discussion. It is on this basis that all the Courts from the High Court through to the Supreme Court, took the position that Exhibit B, the confirmation letter, was an offer. This is clearly distinguishable from this case where there is no evidence on record that the Parties had had any initial discussion on the subject and that Exhibit A herein was a confirmation of any such previous discussion. My Lords, being “prepared to offer … for sale” is very different from “proposing to sell!! It is therefore faltering, with respect, to say that the instant case is on all fours with the Fofie case, for theFofie case to be used as a measuring rod for the fortunes of the instant suit.”  The respondent answers the appellant’s point on the Fofie case as follows (in para.27 of its Statement of Case):  “…As regards the argument that the Fofie case is distinguishable from the instant case because there had been previous discussions between the parties in that case, it is our submission that whether or not there had been previous discussions is quite irrelevant to the interpretation of Exhibit A and that what is important is that the language of that letter expresses and conveys an intention to contract.”  We find this riposte by the respondent persuasive. Whilst recognising that the decision as to whether any particular set of language and context amounts to an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the detailed facts of specific cases, we also consider that the Fofie case provides a useful pointer regarding how to interpret the alleged offer in this case. In our view, the statement that: “The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff,” when read together with the two sentences that follow it that: “In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.” and the totality of the context within which the transaction took place, can hardly be given any other interpretation than that it was an offer by the defendant/respondent/appellant company. The appellant’s argument that the use of the word “proposed” in the text quoted above robbed the alleged offer of “definitiveness” and therefore rendered it an invitation to treat is weak, because of the existence in that same text of the next two sentences. In those sentences, as will have been noted, the appellant itself characterises its proposal as an “offer”. Although this is not a determinative factor, it is an important indication of what the appellant intended.  The first sentence was, in any case, merely introductory to the next two sentences, which contain the substantive offer. The use of the expression “proposed to sell” in the introductory sentence does not, therefore, detract from the definiteness of the offer contained in the next two sentences. In any case, the expression “proposed to sell”, in its context, does not necessarily indicate an absence of an intention to make a final proposal capable of being turned into a contract, or, in other words, an offer. We are thus somewhat mystified by the decision of the learned trial judge. We do not agree with him that the letter of 17th January was an invitation to treat. The defendant/respondent/appellant clearly gives to the plaintiff ‘the first offer’ to purchase its house. We thus hold that the letter of 17th January constituted an offer, and not an invitation to treat, and that this offer was converted into a contract by the respondent’s acceptance letter of 31st January 2005. From the facts set out above, there was clearly an intention to create legal relations and the respondent’s undertaking to pay the purchase price was consideration enough to result in the formation of a contract.  Next, we will quickly and easily dispose of ground (b) of the grounds of appeal. The appellant’s grievance expressed there was that the Court of Appeal erred in decreeing an order of specific performance in the circumstances of this case. Expatiating on this in its Statement of Case, the appellant argued that the doctrine of part performance could not avail the respondent to warrant specific performance. We agree with the reply of the respondent that the doctrine of part-performance is irrelevant, on the facts of this case. We have held that a contract was formed by the exchange of letters in January 2005. This contract relating to land is evidenced in writing. Therefore, there is no need to resort to a doctrine of part-performance. Contracts for the sale of land are preeminently those in relation to which the remedy of specific performance is appropriate and typically applied by the courts. As Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition) puts it (in para 28-007):  “The law takes the view that the purchaser of a particular piece of land or of a particular house (however ordinary) cannot, on the vendor’s breach, obtain a satisfactory substitute, so that specific performance is available to him.”  It is trite law that the equitable remedy of specific performance will be granted, where damages are not an adequate remedy. More recent case-law has tended to state the law in terms of whether it is just in all the circumstances of a particular case for the aggrieved party to be confined to a remedy of damages. However the question is framed, though, there is little doubt that contracts for the sale of land qualify for the remedy, ceteris paribus. We therefore think there is no merit in this ground of appeal and it is dismissed.  Finally, we will consider grounds (c) and (d) of the grounds of appeal. It will be recalled that these complained that the Court of Appeal’s order to the appellant to refund to the respondent all rents paid by the respondent to the appellant was in error and, further, that the Court of Appeal erred when it retrospectively decreed specific performance of the contract without awarding the plaintiff interest on the purchase price. The appellant contends, in its Statement of Case, that if the respondent had paid the consideration for the contract, which we have found to exist, when it was due, or even at the commencement of the suit, the appellant could have invested that price. The appellant further argues that judicial notice should be taken of the notorious fact that in Ghana property values appreciate. It would thus be unfair for the respondent to pay what is in effect a 2005 price for the property today without the payment of interest to compensate the appellant for the difference in the value of the property between 2005 and currently. The appellant argues that since the price of US $ 70,307 should have been paid in August 2005, “By denying the Appellant interest on the purchase price (and assuming there was a binding contract which is denied), the Respondent had been unjustly enriched thereby.” (Para. 18 of the Statement of Case.)  In reply, the respondent maintains in her Statement of Case that the Court of Appeal was not in error in making the consequential order, after delivering its judgment, that any rents paid by the respondent after November 2005 should be refunded to her, after she had paid the purchase price. She explains that the circumstances that had led to that order were the need to reverse the High Court’s order, made after its judgment, which required the respondent, as part of the terms on which the High Court judgment was stayed, to pay c1,500,000 (GHc150) monthly to the appellant. She argued that since the Court of Appeal had found that she was the equitable owner of the property from January 2005, there was no obligation on her part to pay any rent to the appellant. The reversal of the High Court’s order was thus necessary to reflect the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the High Court’s decision that there was no contract between the parties. We have no difficulty in agreeing with this view and we thus affirm the Court of Appeal’s order that any rents paid to appellant after the High Court’s judgment should be refunded after the order of specific performance has been executed.  Regarding the distinct issue of the payment of interest on the purchase price, which had been computed with a completion date in 2005 in mind, the counter-argument put up by the respondent is that the appellant failed to provide the respondent with the bank particulars that she had requested to enable her to make payment of the purchase price. Further, she argued that in none of the papers filed before the Court of Appeal was there a claim of interest on the basis of which the Court would have had jurisdiction to award interest in the appellant’s favour.  In considering what merit there is in this latter argument against the payment of interest, we consider it helpful to refer to the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Butt v Chapel Hill Properties & Anor \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 636 at p. 652:  “Once this Court holds that there was, in effect, an implied loan transaction between the Plaintiff and the first Defendant or the Defendants, the Court is obliged to exercise its statutory power to award interest on the loan implied in order to preserve the value of the capital originally borrowed. Justice requires that on the facts of this case interest be awarded to the Plaintiff, even if not expressly claimed. The High Court, under Order 63 rule 6 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 LN140A, has authority to make any order which it considers necessary for doing justice, whether such order has been expressly asked for by the person entitled to the benefit of the order or not. This is an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to exercise this power of the High Court, pursuant to section 2(4) of the Courts Act 1993 under which the Supreme Court has all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in any court established by the Constitution or any other law.”  Although the Order 63 rule 6 of the repealed High Court Rules referred to in the passage quoted above appears not to have been re-enacted in the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (CI 47), we believe that the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to make such consequential orders as are necessary for doing justice, even if the beneficiary of such order has not expressly requested it. The Supreme Court would thus vicariously also have this power.  In our view, the effect of ordering specific performance of the contract is that the purchaser becomes liable to pay the price at the contractually stipulated due date. On the facts of this case, the price was to be paid within 6 months. Since the acceptance letter was dated 31st January, the due date was no later than the end of July 2005. Correspondingly, the vendor is obliged to convey its interest to the purchaser with effect from the same date. Prior to conveyance and after the conclusion of the contract, the purchaser is the owner of the property in equity. It follows from the analysis above that the purchaser should be liable to pay interest on the purchase price from the date it was due until the date of judgment in order to preserve the economic value of the purchase price.  This Court has power under Rule 1 of the Court (Award of Interest and Post Judgment Interest) Rules 2005 (CI 52) to award interest “on a sum of money due to a party” in an action and we consider that this case is an appropriate one in which to exercise the power in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. As the appellant points out, there is danger of unjust enrichment on the part of the purchaser (i.e., the respondent) if the power to award interest is not exercised. Accordingly, whilst confirming the Court of Appeal’s order of specific performance, we also order, pursuant to Rule 1 of CI 52, that the respondent should pay interest to the appellant on the cedi equivalent of the price of US $ 70,307 from 1st August 2005 till today at the bank rate prevailing today. We do not consider that the neglect of the appellant to furnish the respondent with the particulars of the bank account into which the price should be paid is sufficient reason for the appellant to forfeit its entitlement to interest. That neglect was in the heat of a legal dispute which has only now been finally settled. Since specific performance is an equitable remedy, its enforcement should not lead to the inflicting of hardship on the appellant. As Lord Parker has said:  “Indeed, the dominant principle has always been that equity will only grant specific performance if, under all the circumstances, it is just and equitable so to do.” (See Stickney v Keeble\[1915\] AC 386 at p. 419).  It is our considered view that in the circumstances of this case, it would only be just and equitable for the contract of January 2005 to be specifically enforced if the value of the purchase price under it is preserved through the payment of interest by the respondent to the appellant, along the lines already explained. Accordingly, ground (d) of the appellant’s grounds of appeal is upheld and the respondent is to pay interest on the purchase price to the appellant at the bank rate prevailing today, as already indicated, on the purchase price from 1st August 2005 till today. After judgment, interest will remain payable, by operation of law, till date of final payment, pursuant to Rule 2 of CI 52. Subject to this, the appeal is dismissed.  DR. S. K.

"The court proceeded further to mention three such blunders, as error on the face of a crucial documentary evidence, and finally, “the finding is so based on erroneous proposition of law, that if that proposition be corrected the finding disappears”. It is important to point out that the establishment of a blunder or error per se is not enough. It must further be established that the said error has led to a miscarriage of justice. We do not think the appellant herein discharged the burden on him or passed the test in the case cited so as to warrant the findings of fact and the principles of law applied by the lower courts, to be interfered with or set aside in this appeal. We rather affirm all of them and dismiss all grounds of appeal, original and or additional. For all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

CYNTHIA ADWOA OPARE FOR THE DEFENDANT/ RESPONDENT/ RESPONDENT.  J U D G M E N T  ARYEETEY, JSC  The plaintiff company was a registered distributor of flour supplied by the defendant company and it surrendered additional documents to the defendant company, pursuant to a supposed mortgage transaction they entered into, so as to secure payment for the increase in the supply of flour to the plaintiff company.  However, the defendant company did not supply additional quantities of flour to the plaintiff as presumably envisaged because the plaintiff was already indebted to the defendant. When the plaintiff company demanded the demanded the return of its documents the defendant refused to do so. Therefore, for his remedy, as per his amended writ of summons, the plaintiff sued the defendant for following reliefs:  a)The return of the following documents unlawfully detained by the defendant.  i)Document No.B3289 registered as document No. 89/43 relating to House Number 327/1 Ashanti Road, Cape Coast, executed between E.C Wryter and Elizabeth Derby and her children.  ii)Uncompleted House No. GHWA4 on Plot No.3 documented as CR 71/95 and stamped as LVB/CR/1331A/95 in the name of Bontena Ltd Green Hill, Cape Coast.  iii)Document No. 70A/95 stamped as LVB/1330-1330A/95/ Plot No. 12 A situated at Green Hill Cape Coast in the name of Bontena Ltd.  iv)Document No. CCT682/83 stamped as LVB/CR/633A-633A/94 on Plot Nos. 96, 97, 98, 99, and 1090 at Elwn.  b)Damages for unlawful detention of the documents of the Plaintiff mentioned supra, to be determined or calculated as at the date of judgment.  Thedefendant pleaded and gave evidence that it had surrendered the documents to the plaintiff when it obtained judgment for the recovery of the debt owed it by the plaintiff.  The substance of the present suit at the High Court was the recovery of one of the documents surrendered to the defendant but which was not returned to the plaintiff company when the defendant returned the others to it, namely the original of document, No. G27/1, Ashanti Road, Cape Coast. In actual fact the defendant company did return a certified true copy of that document to the plaintiff company and not the original one. At the end of a trial,the High Court, Sekondi, presided over by His Lordship Mr. Justice Anthony Oppong, entered judgment in favour of the defendant company, in a well reasoned judgment.  The plaintiff was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the judgment of the High Court and dismissed the appeal before it. The defendant once again appealed to this court on the original grounds that:  “i. The finding that the defendants promptly returned the four documents to the plaintiff is not supported by evidence on record.  ii. The Court of Appeal failed adequately or at all to consider the loss to the plaintiff/appellant of the continued retention of the appellant’s title.  iii. The Court of Appeal erroneously applied Section 3 (i) (b) of the Mortgages Decree, 1972, (NRCD 96).  iv. The conclusion of the Court of Appeal to the effect that the continued retention of the appellant’s documents is inconsistent with its finding that “the defendant promptly returned the four documents to the plaintiff.”  Pursuant to leave granted by this court on 11/01/11 the plaintiff filed additional grounds of appeal on 14/1/11, namely:  “1. That the holding that the plaintiff deposited the four documents in addition to the previous two to secure the payment of debt arising out of flour supplied to her by the defendant on credit is not borne out from the evidence.  2\. That the Court failed to adequately or at all to (sic) consider the case of the plaintiff/appellant that the four documents the subject of this appeal were deposited in anticipation of future supply and not in respect of flour already supplied.  3\. The holding that the plaintiff’s complaint for the production of the original document forwarded to the defendant/respondent is a moot one is erroneous in law.  4\. That the Court of Appeal erred in law when it held that a certified true copy satisfies the requirement of the law having regard to the peculiar circumstances of the case and the provisions of Section 10(3) of the Mortgages Decree NRCD 96.”  The plaintiff is hereafter called the appellant and the defendant the respondent in this opinion. It was trite learning that an appeal to this court is by way of rehearing.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the findings of the High Court that the appellant charged their title documents covering the properties as security for the due repayment of the cost of the flour supplied to them, and that there was justification for their retention as long as there was debt due and owing to the respondent.  There is evidence that the respondent had to take action in court for the recovery of debts owed it by the appellant successfully. The appellant had to settle the judgment debt by instalment payments. The appellant pleaded in their statement of claim that it forwarded the four documents to the respondent company with a view to contracting for the supply of flour. The evidence of the appellant’s sole witness at the trial in his viva voce evidence was that the appellant company mortgaged first, two documents of a property upon the value of which the respondent supplied it with goods. Later they were increased to four so that extra supply could be made in its favour.  The appellant’s own evidence led through its representative, the Operations Director, Mr. Peter Stephen Wryter, was that when the respondent stopped supplying the appellant flour, the latter owed the respondent for supply made earlier, in respect of which the two documents had been mortgaged. Apparently, the extra supply of flour could not be made since the debt owed to the respondent had not been discharged. In fact there was evidence that the appellant company was sued for the recovery of that debt successfully. It became reasonable that all documents surrendered by the appellant to the respondent were in respect of the debt that arose from the supply of flour but not in respect of the agreement for the supply that was never made.  The trial High Court and the Court of Appeal were right in findingthat the four documents were deposited for the supply of flour. In the result, grounds i and ii of the original grounds of appeal fail and are therefore dismissed.  Grounds 1. and 2 the additional grounds of appeal do not merit any lengthy consideration; the reason is that there was ample evidence that the respondent retained the documents and sued successfully for the recovery of the debt owed and before the appellant paid the debt in full by instalments. Under cross-examination the appellant said through its representative that the final instalment was made in November 2001 and that very month five of the documents were released to them albeit except the original 89/43.  There was no gainsaying that the evidence was clear the respondent retained the documents for the appellant owed in payment of flour supplied to it. The respondent sued for the recovery of the sum owed and the appellant paid the debt by paying in instalments; when the last instalment was paid in November 2001, the respondent released the originals of the documents with the exception of one of them that very month.  That meant they were released ‘promptly’ or as soon as the sum owed was paid in full in the last installment. That was how the judgment of the Court of Appeal is to be understood. In conclusion grounds (i) and (iv) of appeal carry no weight and are dismissed. The respondent’s supply of flour to the appellant was terminated in 1998. It was not until November 1999 that the documents were returned to the appellants. That was because the appellant had been indebted to the respondent. the respondent owed a duty to pay the respondent for goods supplied him; the respondent was anunpaid seller in terms of the law on the sale of goods. As such unpaid seller one of his remedies under the law in theSale of Goods Act 1963, Act 137, was that he had alien on the goods and he may retain their possession until payment or tender of the price; see Section 36 (1) of the Act for analogy.  ‘‘A lien is the right to hold property of another for the performance of an obligation. A common law lien lasts only so long as possession is retained. A possessory lien is the right of the creditor to retain possession of the debtor’s property until his debt has been satisfied. A particular lien exists only as a security for the particular debt incurred; while a general lien is available as a security for all debts arising out of similar transaction between the parties…A charging lien is the right to charge property in another’s possession with the payment of a debt or the performance of a duty’’:  seeOsborn’s Concise Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition at page 202, (emphasis supplied.) and alsoSnell’s Principles of Equity, Twenty-Seventh Edition, 438. The trial judge relied on the definition of a lien as provided for in Halsbury’s Laws of England 4th Edition Volume 28 paragraph 502at page 221 that:  “Lien in its primary or legal sense is a right in one man to retain that which is rightfully and continuously in his possession belonging to another until the present and the accrued claim of the person in possession are satisfied. In this primary sense it is given by law and not by contract.”  Thus, on the evidence on record, so long as a debt existed on the earlier transaction between the parties herein, the respondent had the general lien over the documents surrendered to the respondent, till all debts due and owing by the appellant were satisfied.  In the result there was ample reason to affirm the Court of Appeal in its holding that the retention of the documents by the respondent was lawful for the respondent exercised a right of lien over them.  The appellant made capital of the fact that a document was not returned as the original that it was when it was first deposited; it was a certified true copy that was returned. Therefore the respondent failed to return the documents ‘in whole, undefaced or lost.’  The appellant did not mince his words when he submitted there was no evidence the document was lost. It did not raise any issue that it was not what was given to the respondent, or that the contents had changed in any way. Under Section 166 of theEvidence Act, 1975,  ‘‘A duplicate of a writing is admissible to the same extent as an original, unless  a)genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or the duplicate, or  b)in the circumstance it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.”  The appellant did not show in the least it would be unfair to admit the duplicate or certified true copy of what was surrendered to it by the respondent. The duplicate or certified true copy was rightly held to be treated as original by the Court of Appeal.  That ground of appeal is also accordingly dismissed.  Considering the record as a whole it was clear the Court of Appeal concurred with the findings of facts and conclusions of law by the trial High Court. The law on situations such as obtained in this case has been stated several times over by this court and must be repeated only for emphasis that:  The principle governing appeals against concurrent findings of fact as in the instant case, had been stated and re-stated on a number of occasions in this court. In a recent unanimous decision in a chieftaincy appeal,Achoro v Akanfela delivered on 9 July 1996 and reported in \[1996-97\] SCGLR 209, ante, Acquah, as he then was, JSC at 214-215 said:  ” … in an appeal against findings of fact to a second appellate court, like this court, where the lower appellate court had concurred in the findings of the trial court, …. this court will not interfere with the concurrent findings of the lower courts unless it is established with absolute clearness that some blunder or error resulting in a miscarriage of justice, is apparent in the way in which the lower tribunals had dealt with the facts”.  The court proceeded further to mention three such blunders, as error on the face of a crucial documentary evidence, and finally, “the finding is so based on erroneous proposition of law, that if that proposition be corrected the finding disappears”. It is important to point out that the establishment of a blunder or error per se is not enough. It must further be established that the said error has led to a miscarriage of justice.  We do not think the appellant herein discharged the burden on him or passed the test in the case cited so as to warrant the findings of fact and the principles of law applied by the lower courts, to be interfered with or set aside in this appeal. We rather affirm all of them and dismiss all grounds of appeal, original and or additional.  For all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.  (SGD) B.

"JUDGMENT  DR. DATE-BAH JSC: This case calls for resort to the basic analytical tools for determining the formation of contracts, including offer, invitation to treat, acceptance and intention to create legal relations, which are to be found set out in the earlier chapters of textbooks, and practice books, on the law of contract. To our mind, the outcome from the application of those tools is clear and self-evident. We are, thus, surprised that this case has had to travel this far for its resolution.  The plaintiff at one time worked for the defendant as head of its Legal Department. Whilst still in its employment, she received the following letter from the defendant.  “17 January 2005  Ms. Yaa Antwi  NTHC Limited  ACCRA  Dear Madam  OFFER FOR SALE – HOUSE NO. 4 PLATEAU CLOSE  EAST LEGON EXTENSION  The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff.  In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.  If you are interested, you are to indicate, in writing, to the undersigned by Monday, 31 January 2005.  Yours faithfully  Gladys A. Odoi (Ms)  Board Secretary  Cc Managing Director”  The plaintiff, in reply to this letter, stated in a letter dated 31st January, 2005 that:  “I refer to the offer by the Board to sell the above-referenced house to me as contained in your letter of January 17, 2005 referenced NTHC/ADMI/GEN/.  I accept the offer to purchase House No. 4 Plateau Close at the cost price of US $ 70,307 or its cedis equivalent and to make payment within the stipulated 6 months.  It would be greatly appreciated if details of bank accounts into which payment may be made are provided for the benefit of the house loan company.”  There was no further correspondence between the parties until the dispatch of the following letter, dated 7th November, 2005 by the defendant to the plaintiff:  “Dear Ms. Antwi  RE: OFFER FOR SALE – HOUSE NO 4 PLATEAU CLOSE, EAST LEGON  I am directed by the Board Chairman to inform you that, as was previously communicated to you following extensive deliberations on the above matter, the Board of Directors have decided to withdraw the offer for sale of the said property to enable the Company house its new management staff.  Any inconvenience is very much regretted.”  This letter was signed on behalf of the defendant by its Deputy Managing Director.  In the meantime, the plaintiff had left the employment of the defendant and had begun working for a different employer from 8th August, 2005. This fact was relied upon by the defendant in its next letter to the plaintiff, dated 10th November, 2005, which sought to require the plaintiff to vacate the house in dispute. The letter advised the plaintiff to vacate the house, following her resignation from the employment of the defendant.  On these facts, the plaintiff brought action against the defendant, claiming that the exchange of letters in January 2005 resulted in an agreement that the defendant would sell to the plaintiff House No. 4 Plateau Close, East Legon Extension for the sum of US $ 70,307 or its equivalent in cedis and that the plaintiff would pay the purchase price within 6 months of the offer. She averred that though she had requested of the defendant the particulars of the bank account into which to pay the purchase price of the property, the defendant had neglected to furnish such particulars. The plaintiff sought specific performance of the agreement made in January 2005 and a perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant from ejecting the plaintiff from the property.  The defence proferred by the defendant was that its letter of 17th January 2005 was not an offer, but, according to its statement of defence, “only an invitation to staff to make offers to purchase the premises, the final decisions on the matter rested with Defendant”. The defendant thus denied the existence of any enforceable agreement between the parties.  The main issue in this case, therefore, hinges on the interpretation to be put on the letter of 17th January, in its context. Was the letter an offer or a mere invitation to treat? The learned trial judge, Ofoe J., as he then was, considered the letter to be a mere invitation to treat. In his judgment, he laid emphasis on the use of the word “proposed” in relation to “sell” and thus persuaded himself that the company’s proposal to sell was not a definite enough offer of the property to the plaintiff. He therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s action, holding that no contract had been formed. Ofoe J. explained his decision thus (at p. 86 of the Record):  “The letter provides that at the Board Meeting the Board “proposed to sell the company’s houses”. I have no reason for interpreting the word proposed other than what it is and what it means. The last paragraph also provides:  “If you are interested, you are to indicate in writing to the undersigned by Monday 31st January, 2005.”  Can it be said that this last paragraph read together with other paragraphs in Exhibit A, Exhibit A was a firm offer of the property to the plaintiff? I think not. It is my view that Exhibit A even though the word “offer” is used, was initiating negotiations with the staff on the proposal of the defendant to dispose of their properties. The request for plaintiff to show interest in the property I see it as asking the plaintiff rather to make the offer. It is my view that plaintiff’s response declaring her interest as she did in Exhibit B cannot be an acceptance of an offer by the defendant but rather offering for the defendant’s acceptance her interest in the purchase of the property.”  On appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of the trial court was reversed. The Court of Appeal, in a judgment written by Marful-Sau JA, arrived at the conclusion that the letter of 17th January contained an offer. The learned judge expressed himself thus (at p. 129 of the Record):  “From the way Exhibit A is written and its content as a whole, I am satisfied that it qualifies to be an offer properly called in contract. The letter was not conducting any enquiry. It is clear from the body that a specific house, House No. 4 Plateau Close, East Legon Extension was offered to Appellant to purchase at a quoted price and to be paid within six months. The letter only requested the Appellant to indicate her interest as to whether she accept the terms offered in Exhibit A or not.”  We are, in this court, called upon to determine which of the two lower courts was right in its interpretation of the letter of 17th January. The grounds of appeal filed by the defendant in this court against the Court of Appeal’s decision are as follows:  “a. The Court of Appeal erred when it held that Exhibit A and Exhibit B amounted to a contract.  Before resolving the issue of interpretation raised in ground (a), however, it would be useful to remind ourselves, in outline, of the principles to be applied in distinguishing between offers and invitations to treat.  Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.  It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer. Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms. Thus Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition, 1999) Vol. 1 para. 2-007 at p. 93 states that:  “A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called an invitation to treat. It is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that it is not made with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as the person to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms.”  A case relied on by the appellant, Gibson v Manchester City Council \[1979\] 1 All ER 972, is illustrative of a communication during “negotiations” which was not definite and final enough to be treated as an offer and therefore was rightly categorized as an invitation to treat. The case involved the tenant of a council house in Manchester, England, who wanted to buy the house from the council. In the middle of the process for the purchase of the property, following local government elections in May 1971, the local council changed its policy and decided not to proceed with the sale of any house in respect of which there had not yet been an exchange of contracts. The correspondence between the tenant and the council before this reversal of policy was as follows:  After the city council had adopted a policy of selling houses to its tenants, the City Treasurer, following a request made by the tenant in this case for details of the price of the house he was renting and the mortgage terms available, had written on 10th February 1971 to the tenant stating that the council “may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price 2,725 pounds less 20% - 2,180 pounds (freehold).” The letter then set out the mortgage terms likely to be made available and continued:  “If you would like to make formal application to buy your Council house please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible.”  Accordingly, the tenant duly completed an application form with the heading “Application to buy a council house”, except that he did not fill in the purchase price, and returned it to the council. The form concluded with the statement: “I…now wish to purchase my Council house. The above answers are correct and I agree that they shall be the basis of the arrangements regarding the purchase…” The tenant followed up his application form a few days later with a letter dated 18th March 1971 in which he said: “I would be obliged if you will carry on with the purchase as per my application already in your possession.” Before contracts for the house could be exchanged, the May elections intervened which led to the reversal of the council’s policy on sales of houses to tenants, to which we have already alluded. The council subsequently wrote to the tenant to advise him that his application for a purchase of a council house could not be processed any further. When the tenant contended that the City Treasurer’s letter of February 1971 was an offer and that his completed application form of March 1971 was an acceptance and he therefore brought action for specific performance of the contract, the House of Lords held that the City Treasurer’s letter was at most an invitation to treat and that it was the tenant’s application form which was rather the offer. Lord Russell of Killowen declared (at p. 980) that:  “My Lords, I cannot bring myself to accept that a letter which says that the possible vendor ‘May be prepared to sell the house to you’ can be regarded as an offer to sell capable of acceptance so as to constitute a contract. The language simply does not permit such a construction.”  We do not agree with the defendant/respondent/appellant in this case when it asserts in its Statement of Case (paragraph 10) that its case is on all fours with the Gibson case. There is no question that the City Treasurer’s letter lacked finality. It could not be turned into a contract by mere acceptance. There were still significant terms which needed to be agreed upon. This is in marked contrast with the facts of this case where the letter from the defendant/respondent/appellant proposed the sale to the plaintiff of an identified property at a price certain. What was left to be communicated were the details of the bank account into which the price was to be paid. This was a subsidiary question which did not affect the finality of what we construe to be the offer contained in the letter.  The appellant also strenuously sought to make a distinction between the language construed to be an offer in Fofie v Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 and the language in the present case. This contention was in rebuttal of the view taken by the Court of Appeal that the decision in the Fofie case should lead to the letter of 17 th January 2005 being construed as an offer. Marful-Sau JA had said in the court below, after quoting the text of the offer in the Fofie case, that:  “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer. The above letter suggested that should the offeree indicate his acceptance, a further meeting was to be held, yet the Supreme Court affirmed the holding by both the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal that it was a valid offer.”  In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms:  “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.”  The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer. The disagreement in that case between the Court of Appeal and the trial judge was as to whether there had been any acceptance of this offer. The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter. The appellant’s argument is set out as follows in its Statement of Case (para. 14):  “The said Exhibit B was thus written in furtherance of the earlier discussions between the parties and was only to formalize the earlier discussion. It is on this basis that all the Courts from the High Court through to the Supreme Court, took the position that Exhibit B, the confirmation letter, was an offer. This is clearly distinguishable from this case where there is no evidence on record that the Parties had had any initial discussion on the subject and that Exhibit A herein was a confirmation of any such previous discussion. My Lords, being “prepared to offer … for sale” is very different from “proposing to sell!! It is therefore faltering, with respect, to say that the instant case is on all fours with the Fofie case, for the Fofie case to be used as a measuring rod for the fortunes of the instant suit.”  The respondent answers the appellant’s point on the Fofie case as follows (in para.27 of its Statement of Case):  “…As regards the argument that the Fofie case is distinguishable from the instant case because there had been previous discussions between the parties in that case, it is our submission that whether or not there had been previous discussions is quite irrelevant to the interpretation of Exhibit A and that what is important is that the language of that letter expresses and conveys an intention to contract.”  We find this riposte by the respondent persuasive. Whilst recognising that the decision as to whether any particular set of language and context amounts to an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the detailed facts of specific cases, we also consider that the Fofie case provides a useful pointer regarding how to interpret the alleged offer in this case. In our view, the statement that: “The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff,” when read together with the two sentences that follow it that: “In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent. Payment shall be within 6 months.” and the totality of the context within which the transaction took place, can hardly be given any other interpretation than that it was an offer by the defendant/respondent/appellant company. The appellant’s argument that the use of the word “proposed” in the text quoted above robbed the alleged offer of “definitiveness” and therefore rendered it an invitation to treat is weak, because of the existence in that same text of the next two sentences. In those sentences, as will have been noted, the appellant itself characterises its proposal as an “offer”. Although this is not a determinative factor, it is an important indication of what the appellant intended.  The first sentence was, in any case, merely introductory to the next two sentences, which contain the substantive offer. The use of the expression “proposed to sell” in the introductory sentence does not, therefore, detract from the definiteness of the offer contained in the next two sentences. In any case, the expression “proposed to sell”, in its context, does not necessarily indicate an absence of an intention to make a final proposal capable of being turned into a contract, or, in other words, an offer. We are thus somewhat mystified by the decision of the learned trial judge. We do not agree with him that the letter of 17th January was an invitation to treat. The defendant/respondent/appellant clearly gives to the plaintiff ‘the first offer’ to purchase its house. We thus hold that the letter of 17th January constituted an offer, and not an invitation to treat, and that this offer was converted into a contract by the respondent’s acceptance letter of 31st January 2005. From the facts set out above, there was clearly an intention to create legal relations and the respondent’s undertaking to pay the purchase price was consideration enough to result in the formation of a contract.  Next, we will quickly and easily dispose of ground (b) of the grounds of appeal. The appellant’s grievance expressed there was that the Court of Appeal erred in decreeing an order of specific performance in the circumstances of this case. Expatiating on this in its Statement of Case, the appellant argued that the doctrine of part performance could not avail the respondent to warrant specific performance. We agree with the reply of the respondent that the doctrine of part-performance is irrelevant, on the facts of this case. We have held that a contract was formed by the exchange of letters in January 2005. This contract relating to land is evidenced in writing. Therefore, there is no need to resort to a doctrine of part-performance. Contracts for the sale of land are preeminently those in relation to which the remedy of specific performance is appropriate and typically applied by the courts. As Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition) puts it (in para 28-007):  “The law takes the view that the purchaser of a particular piece of land or of a particular house (however ordinary) cannot, on the vendor’s breach, obtain a satisfactory substitute, so that specific performance is available to him.”  It is trite law that the equitable remedy of specific performance will be granted, where damages are not an adequate remedy. More recent case-law has tended to state the law in terms of whether it is just in all the circumstances of a particular case for the aggrieved party to be confined to a remedy of damages. However the question is framed, though, there is little doubt that contracts for the sale of land qualify for the remedy, ceteris paribus. We therefore think there is no merit in this ground of appeal and it is dismissed.  Finally, we will consider grounds (c) and (d) of the grounds of appeal. It will be recalled that these complained that the Court of Appeal’s order to the appellant to refund to the respondent all rents paid by the respondent to the appellant was in error and, further, that the Court of Appeal erred when it retrospectively decreed specific performance of the contract without awarding the plaintiff interest on the purchase price. The appellant contends, in its Statement of Case, that if the respondent had paid the consideration for the contract, which we have found to exist, when it was due, or even at the commencement of the suit, the appellant could have invested that price. The appellant further argues that judicial notice should be taken of the notorious fact that in Ghana property values appreciate. It would thus be unfair for the respondent to pay what is in effect a 2005 price for the property today without the payment of interest to compensate the appellant for the difference in the value of the property between 2005 and currently. The appellant argues that since the price of US $ 70,307 should have been paid in August 2005, “By denying the Appellant interest on the purchase price (and assuming there was a binding contract which is denied), the Respondent had been unjustly enriched thereby.” (Para. 18 of the Statement of Case.)  In reply, the respondent maintains in her Statement of Case that the Court of Appeal was not in error in making the consequential order, after delivering its judgment, that any rents paid by the respondent after November 2005 should be refunded to her, after she had paid the purchase price. She explains that the circumstances that had led to that order were the need to reverse the High Court’s order, made after its judgment, which required the respondent, as part of the terms on which the High Court judgment was stayed, to pay c1,500,000 (GHc150) monthly to the appellant. She argued that since the Court of Appeal had found that she was the equitable owner of the property from January 2005, there was no obligation on her part to pay any rent to the appellant. The reversal of the High Court’s order was thus necessary to reflect the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the High Court’s decision that there was no contract between the parties. We have no difficulty in agreeing with this view and we thus affirm the Court of Appeal’s order that any rents paid to appellant after the High Court’s judgment should be refunded after the order of specific performance has been executed.  Regarding the distinct issue of the payment of interest on the purchase price, which had been computed with a completion date in 2005 in mind, the counter-argument put up by the respondent is that the appellant failed to provide the respondent with the bank particulars that she had requested to enable her to make payment of the purchase price. Further, she argued that in none of the papers filed before the Court of Appeal was there a claim of interest on the basis of which the Court would have had jurisdiction to award interest in the appellant’s favour.  In considering what merit there is in this latter argument against the payment of interest, we consider it helpful to refer to the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Butt v Chapel Hill Properties & Anor \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 636 at p. 652:  “Once this Court holds that there was, in effect, an implied loan transaction between the Plaintiff and the first Defendant or the Defendants, the Court is obliged to exercise its statutory power to award interest on the loan implied in order to preserve the value of the capital originally borrowed. Justice requires that on the facts of this case interest be awarded to the Plaintiff, even if not expressly claimed. The High Court, under Order 63 rule 6 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 LN140A, has authority to make any order which it considers necessary for doing justice, whether such order has been expressly asked for by the person entitled to the benefit of the order or not. This is an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to exercise this power of the High Court, pursuant to section 2(4) of the Courts Act 1993 under which the Supreme Court has all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in any court established by the Constitution or any other law.”  Although the Order 63 rule 6 of the repealed High Court Rules referred to in the passage quoted above appears not to have been re-enacted in the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (CI 47), we believe that the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to make such consequential orders as are necessary for doing justice, even if the beneficiary of such order has not expressly requested it. The Supreme Court would thus vicariously also have this power.  In our view, the effect of ordering specific performance of the contract is that the purchaser becomes liable to pay the price at the contractually stipulated due date. On the facts of this case, the price was to be paid within 6 months. Since the acceptance letter was dated 31st January, the due date was no later than the end of July 2005. Correspondingly, the vendor is obliged to convey its interest to the purchaser with effect from the same date. Prior to conveyance and after the conclusion of the contract, the purchaser is the owner of the property in equity. It follows from the analysis above that the purchaser should be liable to pay interest on the purchase price from the date it was due until the date of judgment in order to preserve the economic value of the purchase price.  This Court has power under Rule 1 of the Court (Award of Interest and Post Judgment Interest) Rules 2005 (CI 52) to award interest “on a sum of money due to a party” in an action and we consider that this case is an appropriate one in which to exercise the power in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. As the appellant points out, there is danger of unjust enrichment on the part of the purchaser (i.e., the respondent) if the power to award interest is not exercised. Accordingly, whilst confirming the Court of Appeal’s order of specific performance, we also order, pursuant to Rule 1 of CI 52, that the respondent should pay interest to the appellant on the cedi equivalent of the price of US $ 70,307 from 1st August 2005 till today at the bank rate prevailing today. We do not consider that the neglect of the appellant to furnish the respondent with the particulars of the bank account into which the price should be paid is sufficient reason for the appellant to forfeit its entitlement to interest. That neglect was in the heat of a legal dispute which has only now been finally settled. Since specific performance is an equitable remedy, its enforcement should not lead to the inflicting of hardship on the appellant. As Lord Parker has said:  “Indeed, the dominant principle has always been that equity will only grant specific performance if, under all the circumstances, it is just and equitable so to do.” (See Stickney v Keeble \[1915\] AC 386 at p. 419).  It is our considered view that in the circumstances of this case, it would only be just and equitable for the contract of January 2005 to be specifically enforced if the value of the purchase price under it is preserved through the payment of interest by the respondent to the appellant, along the lines already explained. Accordingly, ground (d) of the appellant’s grounds of appeal is upheld and the respondent is to pay interest on the purchase price to the appellant at the bank rate prevailing today, as already indicated, on the purchase price from 1st August 2005 till today. After judgment, interest will remain payable, by operation of law, till date of final payment, pursuant to Rule 2 of CI 52. Subject to this, the appeal is dismissed.  DR. S. K.

"JUDGMENT  WOOD (MRS) CJ:-  On the 28th of February, 2002, the Appellant and one Billy who is at large, were tried and convicted by the Sunyani High Court of the offences of conspiracy to commit robbery to ss. 23 and 149, and robbery contrary to s. 149 of Act 29/60 and sentenced to life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently. Appellant unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”. He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that:  “…appellant committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the appellant in 2002.”  Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that:  1\. “The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because:  a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The Appellant, reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings.  b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person.  c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the Appellant – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction.  d. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest.”  Given the appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the appellant did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect.  Following the dismissal of his appeal, the appellant first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although:  “...it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable.”  In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the appellant be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of.  At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the appellant’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing.  Generally, the responsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an appellant’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an appellant conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an appellant’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the appellant’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice appellant stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders.  1\. “…The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date,  2\. Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders.”  The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads:  1\. “That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court.  2\. That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof.  3\. Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015.”  Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case.  In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an appellant entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the appellant, are irretrievably lost or destroyed?  Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents.  Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised.  The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend Respondent Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised.  It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development.  We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning.  The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 - Evidence; Documentary 1734 – Court record lost or destroyed” provides:  a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged.  b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record.  28 U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that:  a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court…  b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court.”  States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations.  Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides:  “Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An appellant is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances:  (1) If the appellant has timely requested a reporter’s record;  (2) If, without the appellant’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible;  (3) If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and  (4) If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit.”  The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR, decided August 2, 2005, on the basis of the relevant legislation, set out the relevant factors that must inform the court’s decisions. Understandably, it emphasises the necessity for the court to ensure that a reconstructed record adequately reflects what actually occurred at the hearing.  Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part:  “Pending Criminal Actions  Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the defendant or the defendant himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases.  Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried.  Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided.”  The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities.  Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A401/2011) \[2012\] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that:  “An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the appellant have a duty to try and reconstruct the record.”  Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (105/2007)\[2008\] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus:  “Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E)  The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus:  “…the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b).  The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows:  a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record”;  b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record;  c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues.  In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic \[2013\] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms:  “In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered.”  Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that:  “… the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law.”  The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial.  The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact.  Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors.  First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes.  The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings.  The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision.  Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials.  Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment.  Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any.  We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings.  An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question.  Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record.  If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses.  In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant. But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the appellant in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the appellant was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc.  In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records.  In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following.  Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced.  Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility.  We examine the grounds of appeal in the light of the available record of appeal and we discover that the lost record is most relevant to a fair and conclusive determination of this appeal.  The appellant proposes to demonstrate that no evidence was led in proof of the charges. He questions the court’s failure to hold a mini trial to determine the voluntariness and a fortiori the admissibility of the alleged confession statement. Again, he accuses the trial judge of failing adequately to consider his plea of alibi. Pertinently, what evidence did the prosecution lead in proof of his active participation in the crimes alleged? How did the witnesses fare under cross-examination, if any? Only the trial proceedings could assist this court to resolve these substantive issues. In law, neither the bill of indictment nor the judge’s summing up notes could provide satisfactory answers to challenges to factual findings raised on appeal. The point is that an even well-reasoned court judgment embodying factual findings resolved in the context of evidence led at a trial, is not in itself conclusive proof of the correctness or otherwise of those findings when they are impugned. It is the hard evidence received at the trial that an appellate court uses to determine the correctness or otherwise of those findings. This is what makes the record at our disposal, with the summing up being that which bears even the closest affinity or resemblance to a judgment, wholly inadequate for a fair resolution of this appeal.  The Respondent Counsel concedes that the appellate court decided the appeal wrongly, given that contrary to the decision; it had jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence of life imprisonment. Counsel thus urged that given the loss of the record, we bring this entire matter to closure as it were, by reducing the sentence. We cannot however accede to this request. The appellant has not invited us to limit the appeal to the sentence. He has invited us to do something more fundamental than this, that is, examine the conviction in its totality, an exercise this court differently constituted, has affirmatively ruled that he was entitled to and thus deserves to be heard in this regard. We cannot truncate that order. Attractive though this argument sounds, we would be violating our constitutional duty to do right to all manner of persons, if we adopted what in reality appears to be the line of least resistance.  On balance, we think the appellant having spent as many as thirteen(13) years in prison; believe justice would be best served to both parties if we granted him a conditional discharge for a period of five years during which period the prosecution may prosecute the case afresh when they are able to trace the witnesses. The appellant shall be entitled to a complete discharge if not prosecuted within the specified five year period.  (SGD) G. T. WOOD (MRS)  CHIEF JUSTICE  (SGD) V. J. M.

The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the appellant have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (105/2007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant. But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the appellant in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the appellant was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied.

Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes.

An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Wood, CJ', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2015\\122.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'JOHN BONUAH @ ERIC ANNOR BLAY vs THE REPUBLIC & WOOD (MRS) CJ & On the 28th of February, 2002, the  and one Billy who is at large, were tried and convicted by the Sunyani High Court of the offences of conspiracy to commit robbery to ss. 23 and 149, and robbery contrary to s. 149 of Act 2960 and sentenced to life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.  unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”. He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that & committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the  in 2002 & Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that & The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because & a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The , reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings & b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person & c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the  – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction & d. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest & Given the ’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the  did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect & Following the dismissal of his appeal, the  first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although & it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable & In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the  be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of & At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the ’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing & Generally, the onsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an ’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an  conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an ’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the ’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice  stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders & The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date & Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders & The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads & That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court & That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof & Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015 & Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case & In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an  entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the , are irretrievably lost or destroyed & Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents & Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an ’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised & The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised & It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives.

In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial & The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact & Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors & First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes & The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings & The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision & Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials & Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings & An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question & Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc & In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records & In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following & Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced & Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility', 'short': 'Bonuah vs Republic'}}"
"RULING  MAJORITY OPINION  KULENDI JSC:-  INTRODUCTION:  This is an application for an order of interlocutory injunction pending the determination of a writ invoking this Court’s original jurisdiction. The Plaintiff/Applicant (hereinafter called the “Applicant”) is seeking an order to restrain Mr. James Gyakye Quayson, the 1st Defendant/Respondent (hereinafter called the “1st Respondent”), from holding himself out as a Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency, presenting himself before and/or attending Parliament to conduct the business of Member of Parliament pending the final determination of Applicant’s suit.  BACKGROUND  The application under consideration is anchored on a writ which the Applicant caused to be issued on the 24th of January, 2022, invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court for the following reliefs:  The relevant antecedents to this application can be summarized from processes filed as follows:  The 1st Respondent was elected Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency on December 7th, 2020. After the election of the 1st Respondent, the Applicant on 30th December, 2020, petitioned the High Court, Cape Coast and contended that at the time of the filing of Parliamentary Nomination Forms by the 1st Respondent, he held Canadian citizenship and was therefore in violation of Article 94\[2\]\[a\] of the Constitution and other electoral laws. The Applicant sought various declaratory reliefs: an order annulling the elections; perpetual injunction restraining the 1st Respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament-Elect for the Assin North Constituency; and an order directed at the 3rd Respondent to conduct fresh parliamentary elections in the Assin North Constituency. On 6th January, 2021, the High Court, granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st Respondent:  “from holding himself out as the Member of Parliament-Elect for the Assin North Constituency within the Central Region and further from presenting himself to be sworn in as Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency as such until the final determination of the substantive Petition filed against him by the Applicant.” \[A copy of this ruling is attached to the Applicant’s affidavit in support of this application as Exhibit MAN 3\]  Subsequently, on 28th July, 2021, the High Court gave judgment after trial in favour of the Applicant and declared the election of the 1st Respondent as “null, void and of no legal effect whatsoever”. Further, the High Court granted an order of perpetual injunction against the 1st Respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin-North Constituency.  Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the 1st Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, Cape Coast, seeking to set aside the judgment of the High Court.  It is against this background that the Applicant commenced the present suit and has mounted this application deposing at paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of his affidavit in support that:  “7. On 28/07/21, the High Court, Cape Coast, in its judgment upheld my petition challenging 1st defendant's election as Member of Parliament and inter alia injuncted 1stdefendant from holding himself out as Member of Parliament Annexed herewith is the judgment of the high court, marked Exhibit ""MAN2"".  8\. The issue of the constitutionality of Article 94(2) (a)of the Constitution,1992 has come up repeatedly in processes filed by 1st defendant in the pursuit of his appeal before the Court of Appeal, Cape Coast, and this has occasioned the filing of the instant Writ in the Supreme Court.  9\. The 1st Defendant, however, is contemptuously holding himself out as Member of Parliament and carrying out his parliamentary duties as if no judgment has been pronounced in the Parliamentary Election Petition I filed against him and by reason thereof, I am advised by Counsel and believe same to be true that, this situation ought not fester during the pendency of this suit.”  Significantly, the Applicant continues at paragraphs 10 and 11 of his affidavit in support as follows:  “10. On 06/01/21, when the Members of Parliament were to be sworn in as such in the Chamber of Parliament, even though an order for interlocutory injunction restraining 1st defendant from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency, had been served on the Clerk of Parliament, and this was brought to the attention of the Clerk of Parliament by the Deputy Majority Leader, who admonished and/ or advised 1st defendant to refrain from partaking in the proceedings in Parliament, the Minority Group of which 1st defendant is part, resisted the advice, and was adamant that 1st defendant remains in the Chamber of Parliament. \[Annexed herewith is the High Court's ruling on the grant of the order for interlocutory injunction, marked Exhibit""MAN3"".\]  11\. This incident, which is a notorious fact, was played out on national television and cannot be lost on anyone, and also that,1st defendant flagrantly and brazenly disobeyed and disregarded the orders of the high court, partook fully in the proceedings of that day, and continues to hold himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency.”  We must point out that with the exception of “Notice of Preliminary Legal Objection to Hearing of Motion of Interlocutory Injunction” and its accompanying affidavit which was filed on 28th March, 2022 on behalf of the 1st Respondent, no other process has been filed in answer to this application by the 1st Respondent. This Court directed, in the interest of efficiency, expedition and effective case management, that the 1st Respondent’s Counsel takes his legal objection together with any argument in opposition after the application had been moved by the Applicant’s Counsel.  Counsel for the Applicant submitted that on the basis of the motion, the supporting affidavit, and annexures thereto, the Applicant has established egregious breaches of the Constitution and various electoral laws of Ghana and further that in the light of the judgment of the High Court and the reliefs sought in this suit, the continuing violation of the Constitution by the 1st Respondent ought not be allowed “to fester” pending the final determination of this dispute. He further submitted in respect of the notice of intention to raise preliminary objection that this Court is vested with jurisdiction under Article 129(4) of the Constitution to entertain the instant application for interlocutory injunction and therefore the legal objection to the procedural propriety of the application is misconceived.  Counsel for the 1st Respondent on the other hand submitted that the instant application is procedurally incompetent, same having been made under Order 25 (1) and 19 (1) of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2004 (C. I 47) in the absence of a prior order of this court, suo motu, permitting the recourse to C.I 47 under rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 \[C.I.16\]. He cited the cases of Koglex vrs. Attieh \[2003-2004\] 1 SCGLR 75 @ 85 and Ampofo vrs. Samanfi \[2003/2004\]2 SCGLR 1153 at pages 1155 to 1156 in aid of his submissions.  It was submitted on behalf of 2nd Defendant/Respondent that the instant application is an abuse of process because the judgment of the High Court of 28th July, 2021 has an injunction “embedded” in it and therefore the proper thing was for the applicant to enforce the judgment.  In addition to delivering an affidavit in answer for and on behalf of the 3rd Defendant/Respondent, its counsel contended that the preliminary objection by the 1st Respondent’s Counsel was grossly erroneous since the Supreme Court has settled procedure on the grant of injunctions in constitutional matters. Citing the case of Ekwam vrs Pianim (No. 1) \[1996-97\] SCGLR 117, he submitted that this Court has long affirmed its jurisdiction to grant injunction in constitutional matters where the justice and convenience of a case so warrants and therefore that, it is superfluous for the Applicant to purport to invoke C.I. 47 and consequently, the superfluity does not make the application incompetent.  He also submitted that apart from settled practice, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant injunctive orders is anchored on article 129(4) of the Constitution. He further argued that where the status of a person who at the close of nomination had not renounced his citizenship to another country is in issue, as in this case, the sole factor for consideration in an application for interlocutory injunction is whether having regards to the facts and the judgment of the High Court, the case is one of unconstitutional conduct. He concluded that where the justice of the case so warrants, an injunction is justified even if it will imply a multiplicity of orders, including an order of this Court which is exclusively vested with the protection of the Constitution under article 2(1) and the power to pronounce on any unconstitutionality. Counsel cited the cases of Yeboah vrs. Mensah {JH} \[1998-99\]SCGLR 49, NPP vrs NDC \[2000\] SCGLR 461, and Republic vrs High Court (General Jurisdiction) Accra; Ex-parte Dr. Zanetor Rawlings (Ashittey & National Democratic Congress, Interested Parties) (No.2) \[2015\] SCGLR 92, and submitted that the time for reckoning qualification is the opening of nominations which implies that the 1st Respondent was unqualified for election and thus unqualified to be in Parliament and ought to be restrained pending the final determination of this suit.  PRELIMINARY LEGAL ISSUE:  In respect of the legal objection by Counsel for 1st Respondent, we note that the 1st Respondent’s Counsel neither cited any rule on the face of his “Notice of Preliminary Objection” nor made reference to any rule to justify the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the “notice of preliminary objection”. We think that this is rightly so, because the rules of Court do not supplant the established practice of the Court. The fact that the rules of this Court are silent on any procedure or practice would not affect this Court’s procedural jurisdiction over same. It is important to note that, ""the Rules of Court cannot expressly cover every conceivable situation that arises”. \[See the dictum of Atuguba JSC in Merchant Bank Ltd v. Similar Ways Ltd\[2012\] 1 SCGLR 440 @at page 446\]  For these reasons, we deem the 1st Respondent’s “Notice Of Preliminary Objection” permissible even though his Counsel has neither indicated on the face of the motion paper nor urged, viva voce, the specific rule of procedure under which he has mounted his notice of objection.  Having entertained the 1st Respondent’s “notice of preliminary objection” because it is proper despite the absence of any applicable Supreme Court Rule backing same, since there is no such express rule, we now consider the merits of his plaint on the procedural competency of the application for injunction.  It is beyond dispute that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain injunction applications whenever its original jurisdiction is invoked. In Ekwam v. Pianim (No.1) \[1996-97\] SCGLR 117, this Court granted an injunction application to restrain a non-party, the NPP, from carrying out its National Delegates Congress, pending the determination of a writ invoking the Court’s original jurisdiction.  On the permissible procedure, the lack of express provisions in the Supreme Court Rules, has never been a bar to the exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain injunction applications mounted on the back of originating processes.  Atuguba JSC in Merchant Bank Ltd v. Similar Ways Ltd\[2012\] 1 SCGLR 440 @ at page 446, in commenting on the In Re Yendi case stated thus:  “Nonetheless the Rules of Court cannot cover every conceivable situation that may arise… there is no provision in the current Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (CI.16) offering him relief. In such a situation, as was held, it is reasonable to grant an injunction to protect his interests pending the determination of an appeal even though no express rule in CI.16 warrants such a course.” (emphasis supplied)  Similarly, in Republic v High Court, Accra Ex parte Compu Ghana Ltd; Accra Mall Ltd (Interested Party): Suit No: J5/25/2019 this Court held that theSupreme Court may grant an interlocutory injunction where the original jurisdiction of the Court is invoked.  We must emphasise that the Rules of Court, be they High Court Rules, Court of Appeal Rules, or the Supreme Court Rules do not confer substantive jurisdiction. They only provide rules and regulations for regulating practice and procedure in Court. They are not to be accorded the status of jurisdiction-conferring enactments. The 1st Respondent’s objection assumes that the Rules of Court, as cited by the Applicant, is the law that grounds this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain injunction Applications. This can be inferred from the 1st Respondent’s prayer that the Application be dismissed as incompetent solely on the ground that the Applicant cited the High Court Civil Procedure Rules in the absence of a prior order directing same.  In Suit No.: J8/131/2019 entitled Ogyeadom Obranu Kwesi Atta VI vrs. Ghana Telecommunications Co. Ltd & Another Civil Motion No. J8/131/2019 (2020-04-28), this Court its ruling dated 28th April, 2020 held that:  “It is also settled law that jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution or substantive enactments and that rules of court contained in subsidiary legislation only regulate the exercise of existing jurisdiction but do not confer jurisdiction and so cannot take it away or diminish or enlarge it. In the case of Republic v High Court, Koforidua; Ex parte Ansah Otu \[2009\] SCGLR 141, the celebrated Anin Yeboah, JSC (as he then was) made the following profound statement of the law at page 152 of the report;  “The jurisdiction to grant the interlocutory injunction is exercisable by both the Superior Court of Judicature and the Lower Courts in Ghana. Both the 1992 Constitution and the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459), have conferred jurisdiction on the courts to grant this equitable relief. It is a relief which the common law courts have always granted, in the exercise of their discretion, when the circumstances appear to be just and convenient. It is, however, granted to protect rights and in some cases prevent any injury or damage in accordance with laid down legal principles which have developed as a result of case law over the years.  In my opinion, the rules of court merely regulate the procedure for applying for judicial reliefs. It does not confer the jurisdiction on the courts to grant injunctions. In my view, Order 25, r 9(1) and (2) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (CI 47), which learned counsel for the Applicants has forcefully pressed on this court, is not meant to impose any serious fetters on the discretion of the court in granting an interlocutory injunction, it being a discretionary relief. I think the circumstances of the case must be looked at in considering the grant or refusal of the application for interlocutory injunction. Even though rule 9(1) and (2) of Order 25 requires of an applicant to give an undertaking, it is procedural and should not be interpreted to limit the jurisdiction imposed on the courts by the 1992 Constitution and the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459).”  We therefore must point out that the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts to entertain applications for injunction cannot be traced to any known express rule of Court. Indeed, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court Rules do not even make mention of the procedure by which one can invoke the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain injunction applications. The power of the Court to grant injunctive relief is not expressly crystallized in any known Statute. They are jurisdictions inherent in the Court which spring from the rules of equity and have been accorded legitimacy in our jurisprudence by Article 11(1)(e) and 11(2) of the Constitution. By the said provision, the rules of law generally known as the common law and the rules generally known as the doctrines of equity are much a part of the laws of Ghana, to be applied by our Courts.  The High Court Civil Procedure rules only provide the procedure for the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Court. In the absence of any known procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court Rules, an Applicant who applies for interlocutory injunction and files his application in compliance with the procedure prescribed under the C.I. 47 cannot be said to be in error. This Court, being the Apex Court of the Land, is empowered to apply the rules and procedure of all courts where the justice of the case so demands.  To hold otherwise will be to limit the expansive powers of the Court under Article 129 (4) of the Constitution which states as follows:  “For the purposes of hearing and determining a matter within its jurisdiction and the amendment, execution or the enforcement of a judgment or order made on any matter, and for the purposes of any other authority, expressly or by necessary implication given to the Supreme Court by this Constitution or any other law, the Supreme Court shall have all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in any court established by this Constitution or any other law.”  It is therefore our considered opinion that in the absence of express provisions in the Supreme Court Rules, this Court has the power whether on application or on its own motion to apply the High Court Civil Procedure rules and/or any other rules of any court to determine cases where the circumstances so warrants in order to do substantive justice to parties.  “We are also aware that in many instances like the above, resort has been made to the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47). See also article 129 (4) of the Constitution 1992 which reinforces the above view. We believe that it was the above practice that made the Supreme Court to rely on provisions in the High Court Rules in C.I. 47 on Joinder and for further and better particulars in the recently concluded Presidential Election Dispute intituled Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and two others v John Dramani Mahama and two others when such applications were brought.”  The 1st Respondent’s objection may thus be likened to a mere technicality founded on alleged erroneous citation of the relevant rules.  The rules of court serve as a lubricant. They lubricate the wheels on which the substantive jurisdiction of the Courts ride. They are to grease the machinery of the law for effective justice. They cannot therefore be applied in a manner that causes friction to the administration of justice lest they lose their relevance and place in the architecture of our jurisprudence. Where it is alleged that an Applicant has cited a wrong rule of procedure, the consequential effect cannot be to declare the process of the Applicant incompetent, especially so, when no demonstrable or palpable injury is occasioned the party raising the objection. This Court will not allow unnecessary recourse to technicalities to defeat the ends of justice. The dictum of Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710, CA is of persuasive effect. Bowen has said that:  “... I know of no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct if it can be done without injustice to the other party.""  Even if the citation of Orders 25 rule 1 and 19(1) of C.I. 47 were wrong, which we deem not, we are of the opinion that it is not fatal where a wrong rule is cited or no rule is cited at all, on an application or court process as in the case of the 1st Respondent’s “Notice of Preliminary Objection”.  The Courts have a sacred duty to do substantial justice and in so doing must, as a general rule, look to the substance of processes presented before them rather than unnecessary recourse to the form thereof especially where neither party will be overreached or occasioned injury.  In this regard, Anin Yeboah JSC (as he then was) opined in a judgment dated 1st June, 2011 in Asamoah vrs Marfo, Civil Appeal No.: J4/49/ 2010 that:  ""It is not so fundamental as to disable a court of law in advancement of substantial justice to determine an application in the absence of any order or rule stated on the face of the motion paper but the relief sought must be clear and apparent on its face.""  Similarly, in a judgment of this Court dated 29th April, 2020 in Suit No.: J5/20/2019 entitled Republic vrs. High Court Accra (Commercial Division), Ex Parte Environ Solution Ltd & Others, this Court speaking through Pwamang JSC reasoned thus:  “…The citation on court processes of the correct law on the strength of which the process has been filed is a practice that is insisted upon by judges because it enables the court to understand precisely the legal basis of the case the party is making and for the opponent to understand fully the case she is required to answer. This is a useful practice that advances the requirements of fair hearing. That notwithstanding, stating the correct statute on court processes is not a strict rule of procedure failure to comply with which can nullify a court process. It is more of a practice for the convenience of proceedings than a rule. Courts have a duty to do substantial justice to the parties in every case so a court is not disabled from hearing a party on the only ground that she cited the wrong statute on her process. The court is required to consider the substance of the case presented through the process and if it alludes to a legal right that can avail the party, the court will deal with the merits of the matter. See the case of Okofoh Estates Ltd v Modern Signs Ltd \[1996-97\] SCGLR 224.  By reason of the foregoing and having evaluated the cases cited in aid of the contentions of the parties by Counsel, we conclude that the preliminary objection by the 1st Respondent, is misconceived. We shall now turn to an evaluation of the application on its merits.  EVALUATION OF APPLICATION  THE LAW  The principles that govern applications for injunction, interim or interlocutory are settled in a plethora of cases. In Owusu v Owusu-Ansah \[2007-2008\] 2 SCGLR 870, this Court held that:  “The fundamental principle in applications for interim injunction is whether the applicant has a legal right at law or in equity, which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits. This could only be determined by considering the pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court.""  \[Also see Vanderpuye vrs. Nartey \[1971\]1GLR 428, CA; Lardan vrs. Attorney General (1957) 3 WALR 55; Punjabi Bros vrs. Namih (1958) 3 WALR 381; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 1975 1 All ER 504; Pountney v Doega and Musicians Union of Ghana v Abraham 1982 – 83 GLR 337; Frimpong v Nana Asare Obeng II (1974)1GLR 16  From the litany of judicial decisions, it has also long been settled that in considering an application for injunction, a court ought to consider inter alia the following factors:  These principles were reiterated by this Court in the case of 18th July vs. Yehans International Ltd (2012) SCGLR 167, as follows:  “Even though \[the grant of injunction\] is discretionary, we are of the view that a … court in determining interlocutory application must first consider whether the case of an applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had legal or equitable right which a court should protect. Second the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardships to the other party…”  Further, injunctions being primarily discretionary, the bonafides and malafides of the parties cannot be ignored in ascertaining whether to grant or refuse. \[See Owusu vrs Owusu-Ansah (Supra)\]  ANALYSIS  We are clear in our minds that this application is founded on a writ invoking our original jurisdiction and does not arise directly from the prior actions in the High Court. Consequently, neither our original jurisdiction nor this application are grounded on the judgment of the High Court. However, in the exercise of our discretion, the antecedents in the High Court are relevant facts that will inform our evaluation of the equity, justness and convenience of a grant or otherwise of an order of interlocutory injunction.  The matters complained of by the Applicant, per his unchallenged depositions in his affidavit in support and moreover borne out by the various annexures to his said affidavit are of grave concern. They are allegations of willful continuing breach of the Constitution and allegations of contemptuous defiance of the authority of the High Court, a Superior Court of Judicature. Breaches of the Constitution do not affect an individual Applicant alone but the entire Ghanaian populace which have adopted for itself the Constitution as their Supreme law.  Needless to say the Constitution is the safeguard of our democracy without which the institutions of state would not exist. It is the source of authority of the entire governance structure of the nation.  It embodies the aspirations, goals, expectations, dreams and ambitions of the over thirty million Ghanaians. It is the sourcebook that enjoins our collective efforts to usher ourselves into prosperity. Therefore it is the mirror by which every individual must do a reflection to ensure that our actions do not go contrary to, or in violation or defiance of, the collective will of Ghanaians expressed in the Constitution.  An allegation of an intentional continuing breach of the Constitution by any individual, group, institution, organ or agency must be a matter of considerable concern to all. In the case of Network Computers Systems Ltd v. Intelsat Global Sales & Marketing Ltd \[2012\] 1 SCGLR 218, this Court per Atuguba JSC held that “\[a\]court cannot shut its eyes to the violation of a statute as that would be very contrary to its raison d’etre”. We cannot help but ask, how much more alleged willful violations of the Constitution?  Per the uncontroverted depositions in the affidavit of the Applicant before us, it is undisputed that the 1st Respondent’s election as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency has been declared by the High Court to be “.. null, void and of no legal effect whatsoever”. It is again unchallenged that there was initially an order of interlocutory injunction dated 6th January, 2021 restraining the 1st Respondent from holding himself out as a Member of Parliament elect for Assin North constituency and presenting himself to be sworn in as Member of Parliament until the final determination of a substantive petition filed against him.  Further, it is undisputed that the High Court in its judgment dated 28th July 2021, among others, granted an order of perpetual injunction against the 1st Respondent on the same terms as the preceding order of interlocutory injunction.  These orders notwithstanding, the Applicant laments at paragraph 9 of his affidavit in support which is set out supra that the 1st Respondent is contemptuously holding himself out as Member of Parliament and carrying out parliamentary duties because on 6th January, 2021, when Members of Parliament were to be sworn in, 1st Respondent attended the Chamber of Parliament, offered himself to be sworn in as Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency and has since continued to hold himself out as a Member of Parliament for Assin North.  We do appreciate that it is our original jurisdiction under Articles 2(1) and 130 of the Constitution that has been invoked by the Applicant per his writ. Specifically, the Applicant seeks a true and proper interpretation to Article 94(2)(a) as well as a determination of the point in the electoral roadmap when a disqualification on grounds of allegiance to another country other than Ghana is triggered. To our minds, the Applicant’s plaint is a cognisable cause of action and is by no means frivolous even though we are unable to determine at this stage whether the Applicant will be vindicated or not. Consequently, the writ discloses a prima facie case, is not frivolous and may warrant an injunction.  We are not unmindful of the fact that if we grant the instant application and the 1st Respondent in the end be adjudged by this Court as duly qualified to have filed a nomination and for that matter be elected Member of Parliament, he would have suffered damage, loss and injury on account of an interlocutory restraint. Similarly, his constituents as well as the party on whose ticket he is in Parliament would have been affected. Consequently, the absence of the 1st Respondent, even if temporarily, will occasion some inconvenience.  On the other hand, the Applicant, at paragraph 12 of his affidavit in support, points to the constitutional nature of his suit and laments of “untold distress and loss” for himself and other constituents of Assin North who ought not to have “been saddled with an unqualified person to contest the parliamentary elections of that constituency” in the first place and that “this distress and loss are irreparable and can in no way be remedied by the award of damages”.  The substantive suit, being a public interest action, the persons whose interest are at stake are not only the Applicant, the Interested Party or the Constituents of Assin North but every Ghanaian, because every citizen has a community of interest in the Constitution, a violation of which the Applicant has alleged in his Writ of Summons.  The Constitution itself, in Article 3(4), places on all citizens the duty to “at all times defend the Constitution and in particular, to resist any person or group of persons seeking to overthrow the constitution.”  In assessing whether or not the circumstances of this case make the grant of interlocutory injunction just and convenient the Constitution is the expression of the sovereign will and shared aspiration of the Ghanaian people, and the pivot of governance. It is the highest law of the land and for that matter sacred. This is the reason why any law or action that contradicts and/or is inconsistent with the Constitution would be null, void and of no legal effect. The exclusive forum and sanctuary for the ventilation of any issue of a true and proper interpretation of any provision of the basic and sacred law of the land is this Court. The exclusive reservation of this jurisdiction to the Supreme Court is the constitutional indication of the sanctity with which the framers of the Constitution intended that it be treated. Consequently, an allegation of a breach and more so a subsisting and continuing breach of the Constitution constitutes an invasion of the sovereign will of the Ghanaian people, occasions an incalculable damage, injury and inconvenience which warrants serious and urgent judicial attention and intervention. No court, organ or agency of this Republic can or should be insensitive, aloof, indifferent and/or unconcerned about an allegation of a violation of this sacred and basic law, let alone a subsisting or continuing violation. Otherwise, it would be condoning a subversion of the Constitution and sovereign will of the Ghanaian people in an irreparable way. In this regard, the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the Ghanaian people whose community of interest in the Constitution is sought to be vindicated if the Applicant’s complaint is eventually upheld by this Court.  Similarly, we are of the opinion that the Applicant and the constituents of Assin North would have had an unqualified member of Parliament should the Applicant succeed in the end. In the circumstances, greater hardship, irreparable damage and inconvenience will be occasioned the Constitution, the rule of law, the tenets of democracy, the Constituents of Assin North, and the Ghanaian people as a whole, if the 1st Respondent be allowed to continue to hold himself out as a Member of Parliament for Assin North, pending the determination of this Suit.  Having regard to the subsisting judgment of the High Court, Suit No.: CRP/E/3/21, which was attached to this application as Exhibit MAN 2, the status quo is as determined in the judgment. That is to say that in the eyes of the law the election of the 1st Respondent has been adjudged to be null, void and of no legal effect whatsoever. Until the said judgment is vacated, overturned or set aside by a Court of Competent jurisdiction or suspended by appropriate legal steps, the 1st Respondent cannot be said to be lawfully performing the duties of an Honourable Member of Parliament. The auspicious office of a Member of Parliament is one which is created by law and therefore no person can occupy it in disregard of the law.  It is our further considered view that this Court will be failing in its exclusive mandate and duty to the Ghanaian people to uphold and protect the Constitution if it does not suspend, mitigate or abate an alleged constitutional illegality as in this case or an established, proven and adjudged constitutional illegality if the Applicant were to succeed in the end in this suit. Such a failure, neglect or omission will endanger the sanctity of the Constitution, our democracy and for that matter, the safety of the Republic.  As the highest Court of the land, it will be an indictment of the administration of justice if this Court did not uphold the subsisting judgment pending a final decision on the constitutionality question raised before us. Though we are not exercising an appellate, supervisory or some other jurisdiction in respect of the judgment of the High Court, we must note that through “Exhibit MAN 2” the 1st Respondent has been perpetually restrained from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency. Further, the unchallenged allegation by Counsel for the Applicant from the Bar that the 1st Respondent’s appeal to the Court of Appeal (Cape Coast) has been struck out.  The dignity of the rule of law is non-negotiable. There can be no justification for ignoring the submissions on the continuing disregard of the orders of the High Court which have not been suspended or overturned. This makes the grant of this application more compelling.  For these reasons, we have no hesitation in concluding that an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st Respondent, from holding himself as a member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency, presenting himself, and/or attending before Parliament to conduct the business of Member of Parliament pending the determination of this Suit. However, in order to ensure that the case is expedited the Court directs that they cooperate with the Court. To this end, the Court, by way of case management, will issue directives and if necessary, make orders, as to the future conduct of this case.  In this respect, the parties are to file their joint memorandum of issues failing which they can file their separate memorandum of issues on or by 25th of April 2022.  CONCLUSION  We have considered, in detail, the processes filed in this Application as well as submissions made by both Applicant and the Respondents. We are of the considered view that the instant application has merit and same is hereby granted as prayed. The 1st Respondent is hereby restrained from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency, presenting himself, and/or attending before Parliament to conduct the business of a Member of Parliament pending the determination of this Suit.  E. YONNY KULENDI  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  V. J. M. DOTSE  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  M. OWUSU (MS.)  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  G. TORKORNOO (MRS.)  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  PROF. H. J. A. N. MENSA-BONSU (MRS.)  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  DISSENTING OPINION  DORDZIE (MRS) JSC:-  Facts:  After the December 7 Parliamentary elections in this country, the plaintiff applicant herein, Michael Ankomah-Nimfah filed a petition at the High Court Cape Coast challenging the eligibility of the election of the first defendant / respondent herein, James Gyakye Quayson as member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency. The applicant in the said petition claimed the following reliefs against the first and second defendants/respondents:  On 28 July2021,the High Court delivered its judgment in favour of the plaintiff applicant; it granted the petition and made the following orders:  The 1st defendant respondent herein, dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal Cape Coast.  Subsequent to the above decision of the High Court, and while the appeal was pending before the Court of Appeal, the applicant herein issued a writ in this court invoking the original jurisdiction of the court for the following reliefs:  Whiles the writ is still awaiting determination, the applicant brought the present application the subject matter of this ruling.  Prayer for Interlocutory injunction  By a motion filed on the 27th of January 2022 the applicant herein is praying the court for an interlocutory injunction order, restraining the first defendant/respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency, presenting himself and or attending Parliament to conduct the business of Member of Parliament pending the determination of the suit before the court. This application was brought under Order 25(1) & 19 (1) of the (High Court Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 C. I. 47.  The salient facts deposed to by the applicant in support of this application are found in paragraphs 6 to 15 and they are:  “6.The clear provisions of the electoral laws require that a person who seeks election as a member of Parliament is not qualified to contest as such if he/she owes allegiance to a Country other than Ghana, and also that, 1st defendant held Canadian Citizenship together with his Ghanaian Citizenship, at the time of filing his nomination to contest the Parliamentary Election for the Assin North Constituency.  8\. The issue of the constitutionality of Article 94(2) (a) of the constitution, 1992 has come up repeatedly in the processes filed by 1st defendant in the pursuit of his appeal before the Court of Appeal, Cape Coast, and this has occasioned the filing of the instant Writ in the Supreme Court.  9\. The 1st defendant, however, is contemptuously holding himself out as Member of Parliament and carrying out his parliamentary duties as if no judgment has been pronounced in the Parliamentary Election Petition I filed against him and by reason thereof, I am advised by Counsel and believe same to be true that, this situation ought not fester during the pendency of this suit.  10\. On 06/01/21, when the Members of Parliament were to be sworn in as such in the Chamber of Parliament, even though an order for interlocutory injunction restraining 1st defendant from holding himself out as Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency, had been served on the Clerk of Parliament, and this was brought to the attention of the Clerk of Parliament by the Deputy Majority Leader, who admonished and/or advised 1st defendant to refrain from partaking in the proceedings in Parliament, the Minority Group of which 1st defendant is part, resisted the advice, and were adamant that 1st defendant remains in the chamber of Parliament. Annexed herewith is the high court’s ruling on the grant of the order for interlocutory injunction, marked Exhibit “MAN3”.  11\. This incident which is a notorious fact, was displayed out on national television and cannot be lost on anyone, and also that, 1st defendant flagrantly and brazenly disobeyed and disregarded the orders of the high court, partook fully in the proceedings of that day, and continues to hold himself out as Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency.  The applicant filed a statement of case as well as required by Order 25 rule 1(3) of C. I 47.  The first defendant respondent filed a notice of preliminary objection to the effect that “The High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C. I. 47) do not automatically apply in the Supreme Court in the manner in which the plaintiff/applicant has filed his motion for interlocutory injunction in reliance upon C. I. 47.”  The grounds of the objection are stated in the notice as follows:  The court deemed it wise, in the spirit of case management to have the preliminary objection and the motion heard at the same time to enable it consider the preliminary objection and the substantive application together for its ruling.  In arguing the application counsel for the applicant submitted that the decision of the High Court, Cape Coast still operates against the 1st Defendant and that the people of Assin North need a qualified person as a Member of Parliament. The balance of convenience counsel argued should inure to the benefit of the Applicant herein.  In respond to the preliminary objection counsel for the applicant submitted that by virtue of Article 129 (4) of the Constitution, where there is no express provision in C. I. 16, the Court has always had resort to C.I. 47. There is no need to come for leave before coming to this court to use C.I. 47.  Counsel for the first defendant/respondent in arguing the preliminary objection made reference to Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 C. I. 16;the cases of Koglex (Gh) Ltd. (N0.2) v Attieh (N0.2) \[2003-2004\]1 SCGLR 75 and Ampofo v Samanpa \[2003-2004\] 2 SCGLR 1153 at 1155-56. Counsel submitted that it is wrong for the applicant to bring this application under the High Court Civil Procedure Rules, itis the court, which must prescribe the applicable rule and not blanket resort under other Rules. Rule 5 of C. I. 16 does not grant such a position. The rational is that, Rule 5 prescribes the court to give directions before the Rules of the High Court must be used.  The second defendant/respondent, Electoral Commission opposed the application. Counsel for the second defendant/respondent’s position is that the application is an abuse of the court process and must be dismissed. He argued that the High Court had given judgment and had granted perpetual restraining orders the applicant prayed for in the trial court. The applicant should take steps to enforce those orders, it is wrong for the applicant to be seeking interim restraining orders from this court.  The 3rd defendant/respondent, the Attorney General’s submission is that preliminary objection to the application is erroneous. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction under Article 129 (4) of the constitution to entertain the application. The court also has the jurisdiction to grant an injunction order depending on the justness and convenience of the case. He further submits that in view of the judgment of the High Court, it is unconstitutional for the 1st defendant /respondent to remain in Parliament. Therefore, the application ought to be granted  Consideration of the Preliminary Objection.  It appears there is some misconception of the decision of this court in the Koglex (Gh) Ltd. (N02)\[2003-2004\] 1 SCGLR case upon which the objection was taken. The court expressly stated in that case that it is in a situation where there is no express practice or procedure provided that the party must apply to the court for directions and should not arrogate to itself the court’s powers under Rule 5 of C. I. 16. The court’s position was expressed per Adzoe JSC at page 85 of the report in the following words “In my opinion, where a party has difficulty, or is in doubt, as to what steps to take where there is no express practice or procedure provided,the party must apply to the court for directions rather than arrogate to itself the powers given to the court under rule 5” (Emphasis mine)  It has been the express practice of this court to rely on Article 129 (4) and Section 2(4) of the Courts Act, 1993 to adopt the procedural rules of the High Court where it finds it necessary, so as to completely and effectually adjudicate all issues in controversy.  Article 129(4) of the Constitution reads “For the purposes of hearing and determining a matter within its jurisdiction and the amendment, execution or the enforcement of a judgment or order made on any matter, and for the purposes of any other authority, expressly or by necessary implication given to the Supreme Court by this Constitution or any other law, the Supreme Court shall have all the powers, authority and Jurisdiction vested in any court established by this Constitution or any other law.”  Section 2(4) of the Courts Act repeats the above provisions of the 1992 Constitution. This court in a number of cases had relied on this constitutional provision to adopt and use the procedural rules of the High Court where it finds it expedient to do so. For example in the case of Quist (N01) V Danawi N01 \[2015-2016\]2 SCGLR 1444, the ordinary bench of this court followed the practice and by itself raised a defence of waiver, and determined the case in favour of the respondents. In an application for review in Quist (N02) v Danawi (N02) \[2015-2016\] SCGLR 1461, this court per Dotse JSC at page 1471 of the report held “The procedure adopted by the ordinary bench of this court cannot be faulted, as this court has by article 129 (4) of the Constitution1992, all the powers of the courts established under the Constitution 1992 … This means that this court can exercise, all the powers of the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal in order to completely, and effectually adjudicate all issues in controversy.”  Some other cases in which this court followed the same practice areOwuo v Owuo \[2017-2018\]SCGLR 730 and Republic v High Court (Commercial Division), Accra; Ex Parte Attorney-General, (Balkan Energy Ghana Ltd. & others Interested parties) \[2011\]2 SCGLR 1183  In my view this court in line with the express practice of the court, under the provisions of Article 129(4) of the 1992 Constitution can adopt the procedure in Order 25 of C. I. 47and entertain the application, without the applicant necessarily applying to the court for directions. I would therefore dismiss the preliminary objection.  Consideration of the application for Interlocutory injunction  Order 25 Rule 1 of C. I. 47 provides:  “The Court may grant an injunction by an interlocutory order in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so, and the order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers just.”  It is clear from the wording of the above rule, that the grant or refusal of an application for interlocutory injunction is at the discretion of the court. The courts over the years have developed their own guiding principles in the exercise of this discretion. Some of the recent decisions of this court which have outlined the state of the law on these guiding principles are the cases of Welford Quarcoo v Attorney General & Another \[2012\] 1 SCGLR 259; and Ghana Independent Broadcasters Association (N01) v Attorney-General & National Media Commission (N01) \[2017-2020\] 1 SCGLR 498.  In the case of Welford Quarcoo v Attorney-GeneralDr. Date-Baah JSC numerated these principles at page 260 as follows:“It has always been my understanding that the requirements for the grant of an interlocutory injunctionare first, that the applicant must establish that there is a serious question to be tried; secondly, that he or she would suffer irreparable damage which cannot be remedied by the award of damages, unless the interlocutory injunction is granted; and finally that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting him or her the interlocutory.”  In the case of Ghana Independent Broadasters Association v Attorney-General & another, Pwamang JSC quoted the above decision in the Welford case stating the same principles as the guiding principles the court ought to follow in considering the grant or refusal of an application for interlocutory injunction. Going by these principles, the first question to be answered in considering the merits of the application is whether the applicant has established that there is a serious question to be tried in the suit before us. The applicant in paragraphs 7 & 9of his affidavit in support of this application, which I have quoted above, has deposed that the High Court Cape Coast upheld his petition and restrained the 1st defendant/respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament. However, he had continued contemptuously to hold himself out as a Member of Parliament and has been carrying out Parliamentary duties as if the judgment does not exist. In paragraph 8, the applicant deposed that in the appeal pending against the judgment the question of constitutionality of Article 94(2) (a) of the Constitution had come up repeatedly hence the issuing of the writ before this court.  Counsel for the applicant has however informed the court in moving the application that the appeal filed by the 1st defendant/respondent in the Court of Appeal had been struck out, though he did not back this information with any document, counsel for the first respondent, who was the appellant in the Court of Appeal has not denied it. This information coming from the officers of the court I take as the truth of the situation. If there is no appeal pending against the decision of the High Court, Cape Coast, then there is no doubt that, that judgment exhibited in this application, as exhibit MAN2 is valid and subsisting. Counsel for the applicant had repeated in his submissions to the court that it is the first respondent’s persistent contemptuous violation of the judgment and orders of the High Court that drove him to this court.  It is my view that filing this application in this court is not the remedy open to the applicant. The remedy open to him is the execution of the judgment of the High Court. For the violation of the orders of the High Court, nothing prevents the applicant from seeking redress in that forum by instituting contempt proceedings against the first defendant /respondent.  It is pertinent to note that the orders the High Court made in its judgment virtually addressed and determined almost all the prayers of the applicant in the writ generating this application. I have outlined the orders of the High Court at the beginning of this ruling, as well as the prayers in the writ before us. Reading the orders of the High Court alongside the prayers in the writ before us demonstrates that the decision of the High Court had determined the issues that may arise for determination of the suit before us. It is trite that the High Court has no jurisdiction to interpret the constitution, but the question is, in view of the High Court decision exhibited, as MAN2 is there any need for the interpretation of Article 94(2) (a) of the constitution. In my view, there is no serious questions to be tried by this court. If this court should interpret the said article at all, I consider it an academic exercise.  I hold therefore that the applicant has failed to establish that there is a serious question before us to be tried.  On the question of injury to the applicant or balance of convenience, if the plaintiff applicant ever suffered any injury or inconvenience at all he had been given remedies since 28th of July 2021 when the High Court delivered its Judgment, Exhibit MAN2, which perpetually restrained the 1st defendant/respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament. Applicant’s concern should be the enforcement of the judgment he obtained from the High Court several months ago.  In the circumstances, it is my view that the applicant has not made out a case for the grant of interlocutory injunction, the application lacks merit, and I would therefore dismiss it.  (JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT)  CONCURRING DISSENTING OPINION  AMEGATCHER JSC:-  I have no doubt in my mind that under Article 129(4) of the Constitution, 1992 and Rule 5 of C.I. 16, the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to grant an order of interlocutory injunction pending the hearing and determination of a substantive matter pending before it. I am fortified in this conviction by the case of Ekwam v Pianim (No 1) \[1996-97\] SCGLR 117. In that case, after the applicant had filed his nominations, paid a non-refundable deposit, gone through vetting by the party’s screening committee and was cleared to contest the presidential primaries of the New Patriotic Party (NPP),which had been planned to elect the party’s 1996 presidential candidate, out of the blue, one Rosemary Ekwam, a member of the party filed a Writ challenging the eligibility of the applicant to contest the elections. Since the Writ will inhibit the chances of the applicant at the delegate’s congress already fixed for a date, the applicant applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the NPP from proceeding with the Party’s national delegate’s congress until after the disposal of the substantive suit.  Although the NPP was not a party to the Writ, the Supreme Court held that the Writ will adversely affect the applicant’s chances at the congress. The Court further held that a worst predicament will befall both the applicant and the NPP if the congress proceeded and the applicant won, only to be declared not qualified by the outcome of the Writ; a political fallout which would be incalculable as the party will have to organise another congress all over again. On the basis of these, this Court granted an order of interlocutory injunction to restrain the NPP from proceeding with the national delegates’ congress to elect the presidential candidate until the Writ was determined.  However, in my view, the grant or refusal being equitable and discretionary the applicant must place evidence before the Court that an irreparable loss or damage would be occasioned which cannot be remedied in any other way whatsoever. Thus, in this court’s case of Quarcoo v Attorney-General & Anor \[2012\] 1 SCGLR 259 at 260, Date-Bah JSC, confronted with a similar predicament dealt with it in the following words:  “It has always been my understanding that the requirements for the grant of an interlocutory injunction are: first, that the applicant must establish that there is a serious question to be tried; secondly, that he or she would suffer irreparable damage which cannot be remedied by the award of damages, unless the interlocutory injunction is granted; and finally that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting him or her the interlocutory injunction. The balance of convenience, of course, means weighing up the disadvantages of granting the relief against the disadvantages of not granting the relief. Where the relief sought relates, as here, to a public law matter, particular care must be taken not to halt action presumptively for the public good, unless there are very cogent reasons to do so, and provided also that any subsequent nullification of the impugned act or omission cannot restore the status quo. Given the reliefs that the plaintiff is seeking in the substantive suit in this case, it is clear that if he succeeds in securing the declarations he has claimed, the impugned provisions of the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) will be declared void and any actions made in pursuance of them nullified. Accordingly, no irreparable damage will have been caused the plaintiff during the period between the issue of the writ and the date of judgment. On the other hand, the Government’s programme for the creation of districts would suffer irreparable delay with a knock-on effect on the general elections scheduled for December, which delay cannot be remedied by monetary compensation, if the plaintiff should lose the substantive action.Applying the principles outlined above, my decision is that the interlocutory injunction sought should be dismissed.”  Again in France (No 1) v Electoral Commission & Attorney-General \[2012\] 1 SCGLR 689 at 695,Ansah JSC opined in a similar application brought before the court pending the hearing and determination of a substantive Writ:  “If these reliefs are granted by the court, it will nullify the impugned acts by the first defendant and consequently no irreparable damage will be caused the plaintiff should he fail in the interim, that is between now and when the substantive action is heard and determined, to restrain the defendants from doing what they are allowed by the law to do.On the other hand, if the application by the plaintiff succeeds here and the defendants are restrained from doing what has been complained against them, but the plaintiff fails in the substantive action the injury caused the nation will be irreparable; the national electioneering programme for the year will grind to an abrupt halt. The balance of convenience tilts in favour of the defendants and therefore the application for interlocutory injunction ought to fail. The additional reason is that granting the application will cause more harm to the nation as a whole than the applicant…………………….. This flattened the submissions that the CI 78 was not passed validly. Whether or not CI 78 was validly passed may be determined in the substantive suit, but not here. After all the CI has only been laid before Parliament undergoing the necessary metamorphosis to become a full grown law. Therefore after studying the motion paper, the respective affidavits in support of and in opposition to the application, statements of case of the parties as well as their viva submissions in court, I find myself unable to grant the application, for it is not just and convenient to do so.My decision is to dismiss it and it is hereby dismissed.”  In the application before us, the applicant is praying this Court to grant it an order of Interlocutory Injunction to restrain the 1st respondent from holding himself out as a Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency, presenting himself and/or attending before Parliament to conduct the business of Member of Parliament pending the determination of the Writ filed in this Court. The reliefs sought from this court in the Writ of the plaintiff/applicant are as follows:  The grant of these reliefs sought by the applicant would have the effect of disqualifying the 1st respondent from occupying his seat in the Parliament of Ghana and representing the people of the Assin North Constituency. Until the final determination of the Writ, we are in the interim being invited to restrain the 1st respondent from performing his duties in Parliament. In my opinion, the net effect of acceding to this interim invitation would also temporarily achieve the same results as the reliefs being sought in the substantive Writ before this court.  The reasons advanced for this invitation could be gleaned from the affidavit in support of the motion for interlocutory injunction. They are first, that the High Court had delivered a judgment dated 28th July 2021 upholding applicant’s claim that 1st respondent was not validly elected as a Member of Parliament for the Assin North constituency and had also injuncted1st respondent from holding himself out as Member of Parliament. Secondly, the applicant asserts that the constitutionality of Article 94(2)(a) of the Constitution, 1992 had come up repeatedly in processes filed by the 1strespondent in pursuit of his appeal before the Court of Appeal, Cape Coast and this had occasioned the filing of the instant Writ. Thirdly, the 1st respondent is contemptuously holding himself as a Member of Parliament and carrying out his Parliamentary duties despite the High Court judgment against him and that the situation should not be allowed to fester during the pendency of the Writ. Fourthly, during the swearing in of the 8th Parliament on 7th January 2021, the 1st respondent supported by the minority in Parliament of which he was a member resisted an order for interlocutory injunction by the High Court restraining him from holding himself as a Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency but he fragrantly and brazenly disregarded the orders of the High Court and fully partook in the proceedings and continues to so hold himself as such. Fifthly, since there is a High Court judgment operating against him, the distress and loss are irreparable and can in no way be remedied by an award of damages. The applicant finally prayed the court to restrain the 1st respondent pending the hearing and determination of the Writ otherwise he will continue to hold himself out as a duly elected Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency.  There is no dispute about the fact that a petition under the Representation of the People Act, 1992(PNDCL 284) was filed to challenge the validity of the election of the 1st respondent as the Parliamentary Candidate of the Assin North Constituency. There is also no dispute that the High Court, Cape Coast delivered a judgment on 28th July 2021 and declared 1st respondent’s election null and void and restrained him from holding himself as the Member of Parliament for the Assin North Constituency. There is further no doubt that the 1st respondent appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal, Cape Coast which by the decision of this court in In Re Parliamentary Election For Wulensi Constituency; Zakaria v Nyimakan \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 1 is the final Court of Appeal in election petitions brought to challenge the validity of Parliamentary Elections. A breach of the order of injunction issued by the High Court should have been enforced at the High Court or the Court of Appeal as the case may be. It seems to me that by the grounds stated in the affidavit in support of the motion for an interlocutory injunction in this court, all that was urged on us is the breach of the Injunction order issued by the High Court. In my view, it is not the responsibility of the Supreme Court to enforce orders of a lower court which are breached unless the matter is on appeal before it and it is seized of the matter. Even if we were to accept the argument of the applicant that the present application is founded on the Writ, its determination will prejudice the outcome of the Writ in the sense that ultimate outcome of the Writ is what the applicant is seeking from this Court to grant to him in the interim. In my view, where the outcome of an interlocutory application will prejudice one way or the other the outcome of the substantive application, a court must be firm in exercising its case management powers and fix an early date for the expeditious hearing of the substantive action. Such a directive will dispose of the interlocutory and substantive application in one hearing. The only exception, in my view, is where there was likely to be an irreparable damage or loss which ought to be curtailed by a restraining order as held in Ekwam v Pianim (supra).  In this case, the 1st respondent had been in Parliament from the 7th of January 2021 and despite the order restraining him from holding himself as a Member of Parliament for Assin North Constituency had continued to perform his functions in Parliament without the applicant invoking the enforcement powers of the High Court to deal with him under the Rules of court. In my view, since the 1st respondent is already occupying his seat in Parliament, to continue to perform his Parliamentary duties for another few weeks to enable this Court determine this constitutional action currently before us will not occasion any irreparable loss or damage to applicant or anyone. On the contrary, restraining the 1st respondent from Parliament in the interim during which time debates would be ongoing on the floor of the House and votes would be taken without the input of the Member of Parliament from the Assin North Constituency when the Writ had not been determined against the 1st respondent would rather cause an irreparable damage to the people of the Assin North Constituency who would have missed out on their involvements and contributions in Parliamentary proceedings. In my view, if the applicant would not trigger the necessary legal processes available to him in the Rules to enforce the orders of the High Court made against the 1st respondent, the Supreme Court is not the forum to employ legal ingenuity by the filing of a constitutional action and then disguise this application as an offshoot of the Writ while in substance an enforcement of the High Court orders which is not on appeal before us. It is for these reasons that I concurred with the opinion of my learned and respected sister Dordzie JSC which I have had the privilege of reading that the application for interlocutory injunction be refused.

"APPLICATION by the plaintiff on an originating summons for the determination of the rights of beneficiaries of a will. The facts are fully stated in the judgment.  COUNSEL  J. D. Hammond for the plaintiff.  G. K. Acquah for the defendant.  JUDGMENT OF OKUNOR J.  This is an originating summons taken under Order 54, r. 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 140A), on 8 February 1977 requesting the court to determine two specific issues endorsed on the summons.  The facts which led to this action are that the late Thomas Marshall made a will dated 28 May 1937 before his death. In the will he devised his house ""Jehova Villa"", inter alia, to certain named individuals, and further directed: ""that both themselves (names mentioned above) and their children may enjoy and occupy the dwelling house 'Jehova Villa' as Family House."" Further down the will (and I presume the part on which the argument of the defendant is mainly hinged) the testator directed: ""My dwelling house \`Jehovah Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house.""  It is the complaint of the plaintiff that all went well until all the executors died. Then the defendant stepped in in 1959, and argued that the house in question was a family house and since he was head of the testator's family, he had the right to manage and control the house; he has since that time collected all rents accruing from the house to the detriment of the plaintiff who is the sole survivor of the specifically named beneficiaries in the will. Upon these facts, and in these circumstances, the plaintiff requested the court to determine the following questions:  Whether ""Jehova Villa"" is for the whole family of Thomas Marshall (deceased) by virtue of his will dated 28 May 1937.  (b) If the defendant and other family members have an interest in the ""Jehova Villa"" that is the extent of their interest.  \[p.523\]  It must first of all be noted that the interpretation, construction or implementation of a will really amounts to finding out the intentions of the testator at the time he wrote the will, and those intentions must be gathered, as far as is practicable, from the actual words used in the will by the testator.  In fact, this is one of the main reasons why the law insists that a will should be in writing. Where the intention is not easily ascertainable from the words as used, resort may then be had to the rules devised by law for the purpose. Secondary, in construing a will - indeed any document - the clauses should be read with reference to each other, unless it is quite clear from all the circumstances that they were meant to be independent of each other. Thirdly, a person construing a will is denied the luxury of conjecture though not precluded from making necessary inferences.  This last will and testament of Thomas Marshall of Elmina and Apam made on 28 May 1937 by which will he expressly revoked all wills and testamentary instruments heretofore by him made, read:  ""This is the last will and testament of me, Thomas Marshall of Elmina and Apam and now residing at Cape Coast in the Gold Coast Colony and by divine grace, priest and founder of the National Church of Christ Mission, West Africa (Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone).  I hereby revoke all wills and testamentary instruments heretofore by me made.  I appoint my uncle James Andrew Noonoo Senior of Sekondi, Harry Ghansah and Joe Ghansah (Cousins) of Beulah Lane, Cape Coast, Gold Coast, to be the executors of this my will. I direct my executors to see that my just debts and funeral and testamentary expenses are paid by my sister Effuah Nyaniba alias Johanna Marshall, my nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom and my two legitimate daughters Araba Asiaba alias Catherine Thomasina Marshall and Effuah Takyiwah alias Mrs. Charlotte Marshall Impraim and my wife Christina Neizer alias Mrs. Christina Marshall.  I give and bequeath to my sister Effuah Nyaniba alias Johanna Marshall, my nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom and my two legitimate daughters Araba Asiaba alias Catherine Thomasina Marshall and Affuah Takyiwah alias Mrs. Charlotte Marshall Impraim and my wife Christina Neizer alias Mrs. Christina Marshall share and share alike, all my real and personal property of what nature of kindsoever as well as any money I may have including my freehold dwelling house named \`Jehova Villa' on the part of the plot of land No. 33, situate lying being at Jukwa Road, Cape Coast with its land measuring 200 feet by 74 feet (two hundred by seventy-four feet) where the \[p.524\] school stands bequeath to the National Church of Christ Mission by me and that both themselves (names mentioned above) and their children may enjoy and occupy the dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' as Family House together with the other properties referred to in this will but their husbands or wives they may marry shall have no power whatsoever or control over the same.  At the same time should any of my relatives in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy. My dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house.  Regarding my mission ""National Church of Christ Mission"" of West Africa (Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) I hereby appoint and depute my right nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom to be the General Superintendent to manage and control and supervise the same with the assistance of all the ordained ministers ordained by me in the mission in Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and the General Superintendent (Bishop) so appointed by me shall be entitled to all the Bishop's fund due to the Bishop to be paid by all the stations for his support and general oversight of the work vide para. (35) section 3, page 15 of our Church Constitution.""  As I have already indicated, the awkward section is the penultimate clause beginning with the words ""I give and bequeath ... ""and ending with the words ""My dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house.""  I think the first point which hits anyone confronted with looking for the intention of the testator, and which incidentally turns out to be the answer to the first issue endorsed on the summons is that the testator did not intend to leave the enjoyment of the house ""Jehova Villa"" in the hands of all and sundry in this family either immediate or outer.  He achieved this in two ways: Firstly, he named the specific individuals who together with their children shall occupy and enjoy the property; the fact that the individuals mentioned are members of his family does not to my mind, automatically confer any rights on the family as a whole. Secondly, he expressly stipulated the interest if ""interest"" it may be called - which all other members of his family may have in the property. Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius; the fact that he expressly identified members of his family who should benefit from his property is proof that the other members of the family are excluded especially when he went on and expressed in no uncertain terms what the interest of all other members of his family should have in that part of his will which read: ""At the same time should any of my relatives in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy.""  My specific answer therefore to the first question endorsed on the summons, namely ""Whether the \`Jehova Villa' is for the whole family of Thomas Marshall (deceased) by virtue of his will dated 28 May 1937"" is ""No!"" It is not. To the second question, i.e. ""If the defendant and other family members have an interest in the \`Jehova Villa' what is the nature and extent of their interest?"" The answer is that the interest which other members have in the property has been clearly stated in the passage quoted above in the will itself, namely ""... should any of my relatives \[and by \`relatives' the testator could a only have meant members of his family\] in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy."" Beyond this, no member of the family outside the category stipulated has any interest whatsoever in the house.  As regards the defendant, in particular, he does not even appear to qualify for the gratuitous offer made in the passage quoted above. In his affidavit in opposition filed on 12 May 1977 he describes himself as living at Agona Abrem and in paragraph (7) stated: ""That I am not myself staying in the said house neither am I deriving any interest from my management of the said house."" If defendant is living at Agona Abrem, then I presume he is not ""in need of residence"" and consequently he has absolutely no interest in ""Jehova Villa"" at least for the moment.  As to his own confession that he has been managing the house since the death of the executors, that only makes him liable as an executor de son tort ( i.e., of his own wrong). Any person who, not having been appointed executor of a will, either expressly or by implication, intermeddles with the goods of the deceased in such a manner as to show an intention of exercising the authority of an executor, may make himself liable as an executor de son tort.  Very slight acts of intermeddling will make a person executor de son tort, for example, receiving debts due to the estate. The defendant confesses to collecting rents due to the estate. The executor de son tort is liable to be sued by the rightful executor or administrator or by a legatee. He must account to the personal representative and will thus put an end to his liability except as regards outstanding legal actions: see Hill v. Curtis (1866) L.R. 1 Eg. 90.  Mr. Acquah, counsel for the defendant, draws the attention of the court to the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph of the will in which the testator directed that the ""property in question, i.e. \`Jehova Villa' should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house"" and argued that that meant that the testator intended that on the death of the last of the children of the named beneficiaries the house must remain to the benefit of the whole family because the last surviving child is specifically forbidden from selling it which he \[p.526\] would otherwise have the power to do. Assuming that this was the true intention of the testator, it is not part of the case of the defendant that the last surviving child of the specifically named beneficiaries is dead which should enable the defendant as head of the testator's whole family to take over for the benefit of the testator's family. In any case, I do not share Mr. Acquah's interpretation of the situation.  I have already indicated that the clause of a will must be interpreted with reference to one another, and what the testator meant by ""family house"" was made quite clear earlier in the will when he said the named beneficiaries and their children should use the property as ""family property"" and not his own family of which the defendant claims to be head. The defendant's claims as head of the testator's family affords him no benefit in the enjoyment, immediate, future or contingent, of the property in dispute because the property was not devised by the testator to the testator's family. Who then are the members of the devisee family? Or as Mr. Acquah put it: \`What happens to the property when the last of the surviving children dies without the power to alienate?""  As a general rule, the expression ""children"" means immediate descendants and does not include grandchildren: see In re Atkinson; Pybus v. Boyd \[1918\] 2 Ch. 138. It may however appear on the construction of a particular will that the testator used the word ""Children"" in a wider sense so as to include grandchildren and remoter issues and this may appear in the context of the will itself: see In re Lybbe (Decd.), Kildahl v. Bowker \[1954\] 1 W.L.R. 537. In the will under consideration, the testator obviously a man of a respectable level of education and a minister of religion excluded his family, and devised the property to a devisee family and decreed that the house should never be sold.  In such a context the word ""children"" can only make sense and give expression of his intention if it is construed to include remoter issues of the specified beneficiaries. But one thing it does not, in my view, do; it does not let in either the defendant or the entire family of the testator of which the defendant is head. The beneficiaries specified in the will, would therefore take as purchasers and their descendants according to law would on the death of the last surviving child take by descent ad infinitum.

HEADNOTES  On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.  Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  A PETITION for the official winding-up of a limited liability company wherein the respondents raised a preliminary objection. The facts are fully stated in the ruling.  COUNSEL  Joe Reindorf for the petitioners.  E. D. Kom (Jonathan Arthur with him) for the respondents.  George Thompson for the Registrar of Companies.  JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI J.  This is a petition for the official winding-up of a limited liability company called Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. The original name of the company which was formed \[p.372\] in 1966, was Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. On 20 July 1971, Timber & Transport Co., Ltd., its principal shareholders, Osei Bonsu Snr. and Osei Bonsu Jnr., entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company, Sumsko-Industrijski Kombinat �Crvena Zastava� or the �Red Flag� Timber Industrial Combine, whereby the Osei Bonsus agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav company which, for its part, agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of the company would be changed to its present form, the town of Krusevac being the situation of the registered office and the principal place of business of the Yugoslav company.  The affidavit attached to the petition shows that the Yugoslav company took up its shares, invested U.S. $250,000 as equity share capital, appointed a new managing director and brought over from Yugoslavia a number of experts to assist in running the joint enterprise. The name of the company was on 1 September 1971 changed to its present form. From that moment, it could be said that the fundamental obligations assumed by the parties under the agreement had been performed, and that to that extent the contract was discharged by performance. In so far as anything more remained to be done, clause 16 provided that the agreement should take precedence over and prevail against the regulations of Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. wherever the two were in conflict, and it was further directed that a resolution to that effect be passed by the board of directors of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. and registered along with a copy of the agreement with the Registrar of Companies.  Differences having arisen between the parties to the agreement, the Osei Bonsus have caused a writ to be issued in this court against the �Red Flag� Timber & Industrial Combine claiming the following reliefs:  �(a) Rescission of the contract dated 20 July 1971;  (b) Declaration that the said contract is discharged; or  (c) Damages for breach of the said contract.�  The writ and statement of claim are attached to this petition as exhibits 00.10 and 00.11. The answer of the Yugoslav company is this petition for the official winding-up of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. On 12 February 1979, this court heard and granted an ex parte application filed on behalf of the Yugoslav company for the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as provisional liquidator under section 4 (7) of the Bodies Corporate \[p.373\] (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180), and for an appropriate injunction.  On the hearing of the petition itself, Mr. Kom, counsel for the respondents, has raised as a preliminary point, the question whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition is competent. Clause 15 provides:  �Upon coming into force and effect as aforesaid, this agreement shall be and remain irrevocable for ten years, and accordingly no member or director of the new company may, during the term of ten years immediately following upon coming into force of this agreement, present a resolution to the board of directors or an application to court, seeking the liquidation or winding-up whether voluntary or involuntary of the new com- pany or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the new company to an end. After the expiration of the said ten years this agreement shall continue in force from year to year, and any member or director of the new company who then desires to bring the existence of the new company to an end shall give in writing not less than one year's notice to the board of directors of any step he intends to take for achieving that desire.� There is no room for argument that by clause 15 the parties to the agreement bound themselves not to seek either in court or elsewhere the winding-up of the company as re-constituted until after the expiration of a period of at least ten years.  Mr. Reindorf, counsel for the petitioners, however, contends that clause 15 is void because it contravenes the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) and the Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180). Of the various cases cited by him only In re Peveril Gold Mines, Ltd. \[1898\] 1 Ch. 122, C.A. need be considered in some detail. In that case, a motion was brought on behalf of two of the shareholders of the company to stay proceedings upon a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company. The petition had been presented by a shareholder holding 5,000 fully-paid shares. One of the two shareholders held 20 shares, on which 16s. 6d. per share had been paid, and the other held 13,600 fully-paid shares. All the shares were of the nominal value of �1 each. It was conceded for the purposes of the motion that the petitioner was a contributory who would be entitled to petition, but for clause 164 of the articles of association, which provided:  �No petition shall be presented or proceeded with by a member to wind up the company, except and unless (a) by consent in \[p.374\] writing of not less than two of the then board, or (b) in pursuance or by permission of a resolution passed by a majority at a general meeting of the company, or (c) the petitioner or petitioners shall hold, or together hold, not less than one-fifth of the then issued capital of the company, upon which all calls shall have been paid.�  It was admitted that the petitioner had not complied with any one of the conditions mentioned in the clause.  The motion came before Byrne J. He was of the view that although section 82 of the Companies Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 89), laid it down that a contributory �may� present a petition, it conferred a right upon every shareholder just as much as if the terms of the section had been that every contributory should have �the right to present a petition.� He held that the terms of the section were intended to confer a right of which a contributory could not be deprived, either entirely or in a modified way, by the terms of the articles of association. At p. 123 he said:  �The memorandum and the articles of association embody the contract between the different members of the company, but those documents must not conflict with the provisions of the Acts regulating the incorporation of joint stock companies.�  And he continued at pp. 124-126:  �. . . the question really is, whether or not the petitioner has by becoming a shareholder entered into a contract, enforceable either by the company or by other individual shareholders, not to exercise the right which s. 82 prima facie in terms confers upon him . . . The article which I have to deal with is really an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share, in contravention of the provisions of the Act of Parliament . . . If the articles are to be regarded as part of the terms of the contract between the company and the person applying for shares, I am of opinion that the company had no right, having regard to the Act of Parliament, to enter into such contract as a condition and part of the general contract binding upon all shareholders, whatever separate or distinct bargain they might have the power to make with an individual who happened to be or to desire to become a shareholder.�  On appeal to the Court of Appeal the decision by Byrne J. was affirmed. At. p. 131 Lindley M. R. said:  �Any one who is familiar with the Companies Acts knows perfectly well that these registered limited companies are \[p.375\] incorporated on certain conditions; they continue to exist on certain conditions; and they are liable to be dissolved on certain conditions. The important sections of the Act of 1862, with regard to dissolution, are ss. 79 and 82. Sect. 79 states the circumstances under which such a company may be dissolved by the Court, and s. 82 states the persons who may petition for a dissolution. Any article contrary to these sections�any article which says that the company is formed on the condition that its life shall not be terminated when any of the circumstances mentioned in s. 79 exist, or which limits the right of a contributory under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, would be an attempt to enforce on all the shareholders that which is at variance with the statutory conditions, and is invalid.�  At p. 132 Chitty L.J. said:  �In my opinion, this condition is annexed to the incorporation of a company with limited liability�that the company may be wound up under the circumstances, and at the instance of the persons, prescribed by the Act, and the articles of association cannot validly provide that the shareholders, who are entitled under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, shall not do so except on certain conditions.�  However, like Byrne J., the Court of Appeal left open the question whether the company, or for that matter the shareholders among themselves, could enter into an agreement outside the regulations waiving or limiting a shareholder's statutory right to petition for the official winding-up of the company. At p. 131 Lindley M. R. said: �I do not intend to decide whether a valid contract may or may not be made between the company and an individual shareholder that he shall not petition for the winding-up of the company. That point does not arise now.� And Chitty L.J. also said at pp. 131-132: �We have not now to consider whether an individual shareholder can or cannot bind himself not to petition for the winding-up of the company.�  In the earlier case of Welton v. Saffery \[1897\] A.C. 299 the House of Lords had agreed that what may not be made a regulation of the company binding upon all present and future members of the company may be made the subject of a private bargain between individual members among themselves. In the words of Lord Davey at p. 331:  �Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such way as they may think fit. But such \[p.376\] contracts, whether made by all or some only of the shareholders, would create personal obligations, or an exceptio personalis against themselves only, and would not become a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties to it, or upon new or non-assenting shareholders.�  The respondents have been at pains to point out that the agreement of 20 July 1971 was prepared by counsel for the petitioners. I can well imagine the petitioners as investors wanting some assurance that the agreement would be given a reasonable span of life to enable them make a success of the joint venture. Now, however, they say that clause 15 contravenes section 4 (1) of Act 180, and is therefore void. Section 4 (1) provides:  �4. (1) The Registrar or any person who is,  (a) a creditor of the company,  (b) a member or contributory of the company, or  (c) the Attorney-General, but only on the ground specified in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, may present a petition to the Court for the official winding-up of the company.� If, following In re Peveril (supra), we read �may present a petition to the Court� to mean �have a right to present a petition to the Court,� the question still remains whether it was open to the parties to the agreement to say, in effect, that that agreement was to remain irrevocable for a period of ten years. In my opinion it was. The agreement bound only the parties to it. Even if a copy was lodged with the Registrar of Companies it did not become part of the regulations of the company binding upon any existing or subsequent shareholder who did not give his individual assent to it. Unlike the clause in question in In re Peveril (supra) clause 15 was not, to quote Byrne J. again at p. 125, �an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share� in contravention of the provisions of Act 180, but part of a private agreement outside the machinery of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179).  The law is clear that every contract is prima facie permanent and irrevocable and it lies upon a person who says that it is revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself, or something in the nature of the contract, from which it is reasonably to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination: see Llanelly Railway & Dock Co. v. London & North-Western Railway Co. (1873) 8 Ch.App. 942 at pp. 949-950 per \[p.377\] James L.J. The effect of clause 15, then, is that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement can apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. Here, if I may borrow the words of the Earl of Reading C.J. in Eaglesham v. McMaster \[1920\] 2 K.B. 169, it is not the court which says that the petitioners shall not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves have so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing they cannot complain if the respondents hold them to their bargain.  It may well be that the action commenced by the Osei Bonsus cannot succeed without a winding-up order being made, but as far as the objection taken by Mr. Kom to these proceedings is concerned, I am of the view that it is unanswerable and must be upheld. The application for the official winding-up of the company is accordingly dismissed, and the interim orders made by this court on 12 February 1979 are discharged.  DECISION  Preliminary objection upheld.  Petition dismissed.  S.

"(1) although the prosecution need not call a material witness whose evidence was vital but whom they had every reason to believe would not speak the truth, however, the proper course consistent with the duty of the prosecution to prove their case, where the risks of calling such a witness were about evenly balanced, would be for them to call the witness. There was no duty on the defence to call such material witness as the prosecution, for reasons best known to themselves, refused to call him. If a material witness was called neither by the prosecution nor the defence, the court in exercise of its powers to ensure that justice was done, should call the witness. If the sole point had been whether or not the witness to the slapping should have been called, the appeal would have succeeded. R. v. Kuree (1941) 7 W.A.C.A. 175 at p. 177 applied.  (2) By Act 29, s. 85, ""assault"" covered assault with battery and assault without battery. On his own showing the appellant was guilty of assault without battery and his conduct in rushing at the complainant with apparent intention to cause her harm and intending to put her in fear of danger, fell squarely within the illustration of assault in Act 29, s. 87 (b).

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  APPEAL against conviction for assault in the form of a slap. The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Amissah J.A. sitting as an additional judge of the High Court.  COUNSEL  Ntow for the appellant.  G. A. Orleans, Assistant State Attorney, for the Republic.  JUDGMENT OF AMISSAH J.A.  The appellant in this case was convicted of assault upon the complainant, the wife of his neighbour. There was a second charge of causing damage to the complainant's spectacles upon which he was also convicted. The prosecution's case which the court accepted, was that prior to the day of the incident, relations had become strained between the neighbours. There was a hedge which separated their two properties. It had a hole in it. The appellant sought to block it. The complainant and her husband, taking the view that the hedge was wholly within their property objected to the appellant's interference with it. Heated arguments between the \[p.613\] parties on either side of the hedge occurred over the rival claims. On the day of the incident, the complainant's husband had got someone to remove the barriers erected by the appellant blocking the openings in the hedge. But this man had been stopped by the appellant. When the complainant's husband returned from work he found this assignment uncompleted and he went to do it himself. The appellant saw him and tried to stop him. An argument ensued which was joined in by some members of the households of the men involved.  The appellant is a doctor practising at Tema Hospital. In the course of the argument, the complainant according to the prosecution said to the appellant that certain nurses had said that he had been misbehaving at the hospital. This apparently was too much for the appellant to bear because upon hearing it, he jumped over to the complainant's side of the hedge and gave her a slap which resulted in her spectacles falling off and breaking.  The appellant did not substantially dispute that there had been quarrels over the hedge. But he disputed the assault in the form of the slap. According to him the quarrel between the two neighbouring houses on the material day began before he got home from work. A crowd had gathered to watch it. Upon arrival he went to the scene of the trouble and was hit by a stone thrown presumably from the other side. When the complainant saw him coming she started towards her house. As she turned a corner into her sitting room she slipped and fell at the door. He did not slap the complainant and it was not directly as a result of his action that her glasses dropped.  In both the prosecution and the defence stories the presence of one Mr. Woode at the scene at the time was mentioned. The appellant said that when he came home, this Mr. Woode, a visitor, met him outside the kitchen door and persuaded him not to go to the scene of trouble. The prosecution were even more detailed in their description of Mr. Woode and his actions because they said that he worked with Kaiser Engineers, and that being present at the scene he was heard to say to the appellant, ""Doctor don't do so"" or some such words. He was also supposed to have tried to separate the appellant and the complaint's husband in a fight which developed immediately after the slapping incident. Mr. Woode did not give evidence for the prosecution and the case ended without the court hearing him say what he saw that day.  Learned counsel for the appellant, as may be expected, has submitted that Mr. Woode was a material witness whose evidence would have resolved the difference between the two stories one way \[p.614\] or the other and therefore he ought to have been called by the prosecution. He cited on this the well-known case of R. v. Ansere (1958) 3 W.A.L.R. 385, C.A. as well as R. v. Essien (1938) 4 W.A.C.A. 112.  Learned counsel for the Republic, on the other hand, drew on the line of authority which says that the prosecution need not call a witness whom, they reasonably believe, will not speak the truth; see R. v. Yeboah (1954) 14 W.A.C.A. 484. She submitted that the prosecution had in the course of their case called a maid from the household of the appellant who had given evidence unfavourable to the prosecution and that this must have made them naturally cautious about calling a friend of the appellant also. She did submit that at the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the defence were aware of the existence of Mr. Woode and could have called him if they wished.  The principles relied upon by the opposing sides would appear to conflict if pursued to their logical conclusions. Take the example of the material witness whose evidence is vital but whom the prosecution have every reason to believe will not speak the truth, are the prosecution obliged to call him or are they, in view of their belief, relieved from that duty?, I must first of all say that I do not think there is any duty on the defence to call such material witnesses as the prosecution, for reasons best known to themselves, refuse to call. Barring the well known exceptions, an accused is under no obligation to prove his innocence. The burden of proof of the accused person's guilt is on the prosecution. That being so, should the prosecution refuse to call a witness who could put an issue beyond doubt, I do not think that it would be for the defence to remedy that defect. The Republic is therefore not entitled, on appeal, to make an issue of the fact that the accused well knew of the existence of a witness but failed to call him. The prosecution is therefore in a quandary; should they call the witness and risk him turning hostile or should they leave him out and risk their case being rejected on the ground that it does not come up to proof beyond reasonable doubt? It is difficult to lay a proposition of general validity in every case of this nature. A lot would depend upon the relative strength of the prosecution's case considered on its own and in relation to the nature and possible weight of the evidence which they have omitted to call. But I should have thought that where the risks were about evenly balanced, the proper course consistent with their duty to prove the case, would be for the prosecution to call the witness.  In this case the evidence of Mr. Woode would certainly have helped the court resolve the difference as to whether the complainant \[p.615\] was slapped by the appellant or not, if that was the case intended to be proved. The evidence for this had been supplied directly by the complainant herself and indirectly had been supported by a friend of her husband who said that he heard the sound of a slap before he saw the complainant fall. Against this was the evidence of one prosecution witness, admittedly a maid of the appellant, and the appellant himself. The magistrate had dismissed the evidence of the maid as a tissue of lies. But be gave no reasons for coming to this conclusion. Having regard to the nature of the case, especially to the fact that all the witnesses seem to be committed to one side or the other I think it was incumbent upon the court to exercise the greatest care when deciding to accept the prosecution's case. Without hearing all the material witnesses known, and forming an impression of each person's veracity, it would be dangerous to say that no reasonable doubt remains. If a material witness is called neither by the prosecution nor the defence, the court in exercise of its powers to ensure that justice is done, should call the witness. In this connection I think the words of the West African Court of Appeal in R. v. Kuree (1941) 7 W.A.C.A. 175 at p. 177 are worth repeating. The court said this:  ""It is well established that it is the duty of the prosecution to place before the Court all available relevant evidence. This does not mean, of course, that a whole host of witnesses must be called upon the same point, but it does mean that if there is a vital point in issue and there is one witness whose evidence would settle it one way or the other, that witness ought to be called. The trial Judge also has a discretion himself to call a witness in the interests of justice and we conceive it to be his duty to exercise this discretion when by so doing the real truth can be ascertained.""  If the sole point had been whether or not Mr. Woode should have been called as a witness to the slapping incident, this appeal would have succeeded. But counsel for the Republic has made a subsidiary point worthy of consideration. She submitted that the charge was one of assault and that by definition under section 85 of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), the expression ""assault"" covers not only assault and battery but assault without battery as well; that all the appellant is complaining of is that there was no battery in the form of the slap whereas the magistrate had held that there was; and that on the appellant's own showing he was guilty of assault albeit without battery. In support of this submission learned counsel referred to section 87(1) of the Code which provides that:  \[p.616\]  ""A person makes an assault without actual battery on another person, if by any act apparently done in commencement of an assault and battery, he intentionally puts the other person in fear of an instant assault and battery.""  This definition is made subject to the provision that ""It is not necessary that an actual assault and battery should be intended . . . "" There is much to support the contention that upon the appellant's own showing there was an assault without battery. After saying that the complainant started running when she saw him, the appellant said in cross-examination:  ""I followed the first prosecution witness \[complainant\] when a stone she threw hit me I was naturally annoyed, and I doubled up. I mean I was not angry. I followed the first prosecution witness up to the gate ... the first prosecution witness when running slipped, banged her head against the door and fell at the door, the entrance to the main hall.""  Herein lies the admission of the case of assault without battery. For what the appellant said he did, comes remarkably near illustration (b) to section 87 which says:  ""A. at a distance of 10 yards from B., runs at B. with apparent intention of striking him, and intending to put B. in fear of an immediate beating. Here A. is guilty of an assault, although he never comes within actual reach of B.""  There was no other reason for rushing at the complainant than to show an apparent intention of doing her physical harm and putting her in fear of such danger. Counsel for the appellant has argued not against the substance of this but has submitted that the prosecution ought to have indicated whether they were proving assault with or without battery. I notice that the charge was one of plain assault on the complainant. And upon such a charge it is open to the prosecution to lead evidence which would support either one or the other type of assault. If the court finds one particular type proved then it has to convict.  In the circumstances I do not think the conviction for assault should be disturbed. It follows that the conviction for causing damage to the complainant's spectacles must also stand. For though it was not conclusively proved that the appellant physically touched her it was by causing her to run to escape a possible battery, that she slipped and fell and damaged her spectacles. Consequently the damage is as much a direct result of the appellant's action as if he \[p.617\] had physically touched her with that result. However, I think in the circumstances of this case, the sentences should not stand. The complainant is not without blame. According to her, it was as a direct result of a provocative statement she made in the course of this quarrel that the appellant assaulted her. I have to bear in mind also that I have not been satisfied that an assault and battery, as the magistrate must have thought, was proved against the appellant. I am therefore of the opinion that the loss in the form of the damaged spectacles should have lain where it fell that day. The matter should have been disposed of by a caution and discharge. I accordingly so order. The appeal is therefore allowed only to that extent.  DECISION  Appeal against conviction dismissed.  Appeal against sentence allowed.  Appellant cautioned and discharged.  S.

"JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS J.  The plaintiff, a 22-year-old seamstress trading at the sea port town of Tema sustained serious injuries when a vehicle in which she was travelling ended up in a culvert after an accident at Kpong on 30 May 1968. Her injuries included a number of cuts on her lips and face and fractures on her left thigh and shoulder. There were also injuries to her right wrist and her tongue, with a permanent impairment of speech and gait. But her greatest misfortune arising from the accident was the termination of her pregnancy. It appears that at the time of the accident she was seven to eight months gone. The medical certificate which reads like a medical dictionary has a whole catalogue of injuries the plaintiff sustained. The final medical opinion is as follows:  ""She will be permanently incapacitated by the loss of movement at the left shoulder, loss of power in the small muscles of both the hands and spastic gait giving rise to considerable difficulty in moving around. In addition, she must have gone through a considerable physical and mental agony from loss of a baby which was almost full term which might carry a repercussion in her future well being.  \[p.49\]  I assess her permanent disability at:  Cord dysfunction .. .. .. .. 45% (Forty-five per cent)  Shift left shoulder .. .. .. .. 8% (eight)  Miscarriage .. .. .. .. .. 15% (fifteen)  Total .. .. .. .. .. .. 68% (sixty-eight).""  This suit stems from the aforesaid injuries the plaintiff sustained and she consequently claims from the first defendant as driver of the vehicle and the second defendants as the owners of the said vehicle and masters of the first defendant, damages in compensation.  The first defendant did not contest the suit though served with the writ and statement of claim on 25 March 1969. Consequently on 20 March 1972 interlocutory judgment was entered against him. The second defendants however resisted liability strenuously. Though they admit the first defendant was in their employment they claim he committed a prohibited act by taking passengers in his vehicle and deviated from the course of his employment literally and figuratively. They accordingly repudiate liability.  1\. Issue of negligence  The plaintiff pleaded in paragraphs (4) and (6) (d) of his statement of claim the following:  ""(4) On or about the 30th day of May 1968, the first defendant whilst in charge of the said vehicle in the course of his employment with the second defendants drove so negligently and without proper duty of care that on the Kpong-Tema motor road he lost control of the steer and drove the vehicle into a ditch and consequently caused grievous personal injuries to the plaintiff who was then riding in the said vehicle . . .  (6) (d) Particulars of negligence  So far as may be necessary or practicable the plaintiff will rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.""  The second defendants in their brief defence denied negligence urging also that the first defendant acted outside the scope of his employment. Having regard to exhibits 1 and 2 which blamed the first defendant for carelessness, the stand of the second defendants seems difficult to appreciate. But I shall consider this aspect of the case again later.  The plaintiff led no evidence of negligence except the factum of the accident and the resultant extensive injuries she sustained. But she conveyed a picture of the tremendous haste the first defendant seemed to be in; for instance, snatching her load from her head and almost bundling her into the vehicle as a prized passenger. I cannot be persuaded, and there is no evidence to prop it, that this desire for haste evanesced, nor can it be dispelled for the further reason that soon after, an accident occurred. The plaintiff however seeks to establish negligence in two modes. First by legal and necessary implication from the effect \[p.50\] of the interlocutory judgment obtained against the first defendant on his default to plead; secondly by invoking the doctrine of res ipsa Loquitur.  Where judgment is entered by default against a defendant charged with negligence, who fails to serve a defence, the plaintiff need not prove the said negligence as all the allegations in the statement of claim are deemed to be admitted. See Cribb v. Freyberger \[1919\] W.N. 22, C.A.  (2) Res ipsa loquitur  In examining the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in relation to this case one must needs be reminded of Lord Upjohn's statement in Colvilles v. Devine \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 53, H.L. that the true ambit of the doctrine still requires further elucidation by the House of Lords. In Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd ed.), Vol. 28, para. 79 at p. 78 is the following passage:  “The maxim res ipsa loquitur applies only where the causes of the accident are unknown but the inference of negligence is clear from the nature of the accident, and the defendant is therefore liable if he does not produce evidence to counteract the inference. If the causes are sufficiently known, the case ceases to be one where the facts speak for themselves and the court has to determine whether or not from the known facts, negligence is to be inferred.”  The doctrine had its humble origins in a speech of Earle C.J. in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co. \[1861-73\] All E. Rep. 246 at p. 248 where the noble Lord said:  “There must be reasonable evidence of negligence, but, where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant, or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things, does not happen if those who have the management of the machinery use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.”  Though of lowly birth, the doctrine has grown in stature and now assumes tremendous significance in the law relating to negligence in torts. Unfortunately its growth has not been unaccompanied by complications, especially in its application. The debate has sometimes been whether it applies without any evidence or whether there must be some preliminary facts to usher in the doctrine. The Canadian view which is attractive and logical requires at least some evidence, some material, on which the doctrine can hinge to be supplied by the plaintiff. Thus in Cudney v. Clements Motor Sales Ltd. \[1969\] 5 D.L.R. (3 ed.) 3, it was held that the maxim of res ipsa loquitur could only apply if the plaintiff had supplied the basis of its application. The established facts must cogently point to negligence before the burden of proof would shift to the defendant. This is not quite the English view which our courts have adopted. Here the res speaks for itself. See the opinion of \[p.51\] Apaloo J.S.C. in Dagomba v. Dagomba, Court of Appeal, 2 March 1970, unreported, where the learned judge said:  ""In their statement of claim, they gave particulars of negligence but pleaded in the alternative that the occurrence of the accident is itself evidence of negligence and relied on the doctrine of res ispa loquitur. At the trial, they did no more than testify as to the occurrence of the accident and thereafter gave great details of their various injuries. The respondents for their part, gave no evidence or offered any explanation of how the collision occurred but denied negligence in their pleadings.  The learned trial judge (Annan J.) dismissed the action because he thought the plaintiffs failed to discharge the onus of proving negligence. But before reaching this conclusion, the learned judge considered whether the fact of the collision was itself prima facie evidence of negligence. After examining some well-known English decisions, he gave the question a negative answer. The appellants take issue with him on that and argue that he should have returned an affirmative rather than a negative answer. In my opinion, the appellants are right.""  It must be pointed out that the legal issue being virtually identical I am bound by Apaloo J.S.C.'s decision above cited. Thus also Ollennu J. (as he then was) in Yirenkyi v. Tarzan International Transport \[1962\] 1 G.L.R. 75 at pp. 76-77 held:  “Vehicles do not normally run off the road into buildings; they would only do so in consequence of negligence on the part of the driver, or as a result of inevitable accident. In this case the cause of the accident is peculiarly within the knowledge of one person and one person only, namely, the driver of the defendants. That being so the principle of res ipsa loquitur applies and the presumption is that the accident was caused by negligence of the defendants' driver. The onus is upon the defendants to rebut that presumption by proving facts which are inconsistent with their liability.""  Whether the onus on the defendants is discharged by merely offering a plausible explanation or they must go to the extent of disproving any negligence is still in some doubt. The English decisions require the defendant to disprove negligence. The full bench of the Court of Appeal in Nelson v. Klutse, Court of Appeal, 8 September 1969, unreported digested in (1969) C.C. 142 declined to give a final opinion.  The case of Nelson v. Klutse (supra) exemplifies the difficulty the maxim of res ipsa loquitur provokes. When the suit originally came before the appeal court (Supreme Court, 28 June 1965, unreported; disgested in (1965) C.C. 155) it was held that the maxim did not apply. A diametrically opposed view was the result of a review of the Supreme Court's decision (Court of Appeal, 8 September 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C. 142). I think this decision of the full bench of \[p.52\] five judges is for the moment the last word on this aspect of res ipsa loquitur. I may perhaps therefore be forgiven for quoting excerpts from the unanimous judgment delivered by Amissah J.A.:  “According to our understanding of the doctrine it applies whenever it can be said at a given point of a trial that the res or circumstances proved by the plaintiff are of themselves sufficient evidence from which negligence may reasonably be inferred. And the first decisive point of the trial is the close of the plaintiff's case. For if the doctrine can then be invoked by him, he is enabled to avoid a non-suit or his action being dismissed on the ground that he had not discharged the onus which lay on him.”  In a further passage the learned judge said:  “But there are cases where the proof of the act itself, let us say an accident, is sufficient to raise the inference of negligence because acts or omissions of that nature do not in the ordinary course of things occur without the negligence of the person responsible for its happening. There are the cases where it is said that the res speaks for itself. Where the proof is given by the plaintiff of such an accident by itself and no more, the court is entitled to infer negligence unless there is an explanation from the defendant as to how it occurred which is consistent with the defendant not being negligent. Upon the explanation being given, the court is put in the position where it has all the facts before it and its conclusion as to negligence vel non would be drawn from an assessment of all the material before it.”  Amissah J.A. concluded:  “\[T\]he applicant by establishing the fact of the accident itself, had given sufficient evidence from which the respondent's negligence could be inferred in the absence of any reasonable explanation.”  As far as the English decisions go, to rebut res ipsa loquitur when the doctrine applies, the defendants must give an explanation of the accident which is not only reasonable but is also inconsistent with negligence on their part. See the speech of Lord Guest in Colvilles Ltd. v. Devine \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 53 at p. 57, H.L. aforementioned. That the onus to explain away an accident rests squarely on the defendant once the res is shown is also illustrated in the case of Ludgate v. Lovett \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 1275, C.A. Here a youth who had hired a vintage van which was in good condition, was involved in an accident which left the car straddled on a culvert. The explanation that the accident was caused by a burst tyre was contradicted by expert evidence. It was held that the failure to explain adequately the obvious negligence in a seemingly well-maintained van ending up on a culvert when the defendant was in control, fixed negligence on him. Since a momentary \[p.53\] lapse, a second's inattentiveness on a highway could cause an accident, it was incumbent on the defendant to give an acceptable explanation.  It must be emphasized that the fact that there was an accident culminating in the plaintiff sustaining injuries in the instant case was not denied by the defendants. That fact is the res and the issue now is whether the defendants gave any explanation of the accident. The first defendant declined to contest the suit and though he sat in court was not called by the second defendants to give evidence to explain the accident. The res consequently has not been explained, nor an attempt made to ""rebut the prima facie case of negligence which the facts raise"": see per Apaloo J.A. in Decker v. Attah, Court of Appeal, 22 December 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C. 109.  3\. Negligence against the second defendants  In so far as the second defendants' liability can only be vicarious and is fixed if the first defendant is proved not only to be their driver, driving negligently in the course of his employment, but also not outside the scope of his authority, it is my view that the second defendants would be vicariously held negligent if they do not discharge the onus to disprove fault once the doctrine of res ispa loquitur is established. This view of the law finds support in a passage from the judgment of Apaloo J.A. (as he then was) in Grunshie v. Yeboah, Court of Appeal, 1 May 1967, unreported; digested in (1967) C.C. 96. There, the learned judge in assessing the legal effect of a finding of negligence against a driver, said:  “It is admitted that the second respondent was the owner and employer of the first respondent and at the time of the accident, the first respondent was driving the Bedford lorry in the ordinary course of his employment. It follows that both respondents are liable to the appellant for her injuries.”  So also in Fynhout Production Ltd. v. Kwayie \[1971\] 1 G.L.R. 475 at p. 477, C.A. where Anin J.A. said:  “The first defendant pleaded guilty at the criminal court to the offence of careless driving and negligently causing harm and was duly convicted and sentenced to fines totalling �G65. He did not contest this action, though served with process, and judgment was accordingly entered against him. In the result, the negligence of the driver was not disputed by the remaining defendants.”  It must be said in passing that the plaintiff herein makes no capital of the conviction for careless and negligent driving of the first defendant in the criminal court. I think Hollington v. Hewthorn \[1943\] 2 All E.R. 35, C.A. precludes the use of a conviction in subsequent civil proceedings and the English Civil Evidence Act, 1968, c. 64, which now allows such evidence to be admitted has no relevance in Ghana. The law in Ghana is analogous to the position in England before 1968. Buckley L.J. \[p.54\] in Stupple v. Royal Insurance Co. Ltd. \[1970\] 3 All E.R. 230, C.A. described that position in the following words:  “If before 1968, A. sued B. for an act of B.'s of which B. had earlier been convicted in criminal proceedings, evidence of B.'s conviction was inadmissible in A.'s action. It merely demonstrated that another court had, on the material and arguments before it, concluded that B. was guilty of the act with which he was charged in the criminal proceedings. It did not prove any of the matters proved in the criminal proceedings, nor anything which A. would need to prove to make good his civil claim. Proof of B.'s conviction was accordingly irrelevant to A.'s action; and so was inadmissible.""  See also Kariola v. Mahama (1957) 3 W.A.L.R. 49. But the excerpt quoted above from the Kwayie case justifies the assumption that the negligence of a driver, whether by operation of law, viz. on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, or by his submission to judgment throws on the employer the burden of denying the negligence if he can.  4\. Prohibitions  It was the second defendants' case that their drivers were under strict instructions not to pick up passengers. Their representative put it thus:  “In 1969 when I joined the bank the manager impressed on me that we were not allowed to pick passengers. This was to me as a project officer of the bank at the time. The drivers have been made aware of this. If outsiders have not been told they would not know.”  Earlier he had said:  “Drivers are supposed to drive the bank's vehicles to take project officers and bank personnel on trek. They can also be sent out on bank duties to deliver letters, etc. The drivers are not supposed to pick on the vehicle any passengers but only people associated with the bank, for instance, on feasibility studies, a farmer may be conveyed on the vehicle.”  It should be observed that no written instructions were produced nor proof attempted of the same. The first defendant who sat in the court throughout as already mentioned was not even called to confirm this prohibition. To escape liability on the ground that an express prohibition had been flouted, the second defendants should have established it. In Ghana it is a matter of everyday occurrence, of which judicial notice must be taken, of vehicles displaying printed prohibitions in the body as well as their external parts. This is a warning to the whole world that passengers travel in the said vehicles at their own risk. The second defendants' representative let the cat out of the bag when he said, ""After the accident the position as to the instructions has not been the same. Circulars are now issued to the drivers. I can't say whether the circulars preceded the accident or not.""  \[p.55\]  A recent case on the question of notice regarding risk is the case of Birch v. Thomas \[1972\] 1 All E.R. 905, C.A. In that case a passenger in a car was injured as a result of an accident caused by the negligence of an owner-driver. In the car was a notice repudiating any liability and intimating that passengers travelled at their own risk. The English Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the court of first instance holding that the plaintiff had express or effective constructive knowledge of the facts and the notice, consequently the defendant could not be held liable for his negligence.  The facts in the instant case are clearly not on the same footing. As no written prohibition was tendered no reliance can even be placed on the local authority of Dadey v. Attorney-General \[1971\] 1 G.L.R. 228, C.A. I consequently accept the legal position restated by Hilbery J. in McKean v. Raynor Brothers (Nottingham) \[1942\] 2 All E.R. 650 at p.652 where he said:  “The law casts upon the master a liability for the act of the servant in the course of his employment; and the law is not so futile as to allow a master, by giving secret instructions to his servant, to discharge himself from liability.”  I do not think the cases of Twine v. Bean's Express Ltd. \[1946\] 1 All E.R. 202 and Conway v. Wimpey (George) & Co. Ltd. (No. 2) \[1952\] 2 K.B. 266, C.A. apply in this case. In the aforesaid cases the plaintiff was held to be an unauthorised invitee and therefore could not succeed in a claim for damages arising from negligence. These cases proceeded on two principles. First, that in giving a lift, the servant had departed from the course of his employment and, secondly that the passenger must be deemed a trespasser. I am not concerned here with the criticism that the two decisions have no legal justification. They simply do not apply here, first because there is no acceptable proof as aforesaid of a prohibition on the driver to give lifts. In the passage from the evidence of the second defendants' representative quoted above, it appears lifts could be given to certain classes of persons. It is good law that where a servant is permitted to give any lift the master will be liable. See Miller v. Liverpool Co-operative Society Ltd. \[1940\] 4 All E.R. 367 affirmed in \[1941\] 1 All E.R. 379. For that very reason the passenger cannot be a trespasser.  On the facts I have come to the conclusion that no prohibition was issued to the first defendant against conveying passengers in his vehicle.  (5) Course of employment and scope of authority  The test whether a servant is acting in the course of his employment and within the scope of his authority has been formulated in a well-known passage from Salmond on the Law of Torts. It is whether the act of the servant is so connected with his duly authorised acts that they may be considered as modes, although improper modes, of doing them in contradistinction to independent unrelated conduct. The simpler \[p.56\] test of Diplock L.J. in Hilton v. Thomas Burton (Rhodes) \[1961\] 1 W.L.R. 705 is whether the servant was doing something he was employed to do.  Relating the authorities to the instant case it will be observed that the defendants failed to show how the first defendant had side-stepped the authority conferred on him or deviated materially from the course of his employment. Indeed the first defendant picked up the plaintiff at Tema; but a bare assertion that the driver should have proceeded from Koforidua to Hohoe without more, is hardly legal proof sufficient to induce a conviction in me that the first defendant did not comply with instructions; for that bare statement could also be made to escape liability.  On this aspect of the matter the following answers to questions put to second defendants' representative are revealing:  ""Q. At the time of the accident was the first defendant driver returning from Accra on the bank's errand ?  A. Yes.  Q. This was within the scope of his employment as a driver"" ?  A. Yes. He was sent to Koforidua and he should have returned to Hohoe from there. But he proceeded to Accra from Koforidua and the accident occurred at Kpong on his return.  Q. There was no query as to his coming from Accra ?  A. I agree that did not raise any query.""  There is nothing to show on the evidence that the first defendant deviated from his duty in going to Accra. Whether he was on an authorised errand to Accra cannot be ruled out especially as the defendants' head office is in Accra, of which judicial notice must be taken. No instructions and contrary defiant conduct of the first defendant were adduced in evidence. The fact that the first defendant was not even queried in this regard leads me to the inevitable conclusion, as indeed the passage quoted above suggests, that the first defendant was acting within the scope of his authority and about his master's (the second defendants') business when the accident occurred.  A driver, driving in the course of his employment, ostensibly on his master's mission, creates notionally at any rate, the doctrine or concept of agency; thus his default as it were comes back to the employer unless rebutted. See Rambarran v. Guruucharran \[1970\] 2 All E.R. 817, P.C. where the leading cases are also reviewed. For essentially the employer cannot repudiate his instructions that the vehicle should be put on the road in the first instance nor can he deny an interest in the driver's journey. This was put in language of great clarity by Denning L.J. in Ormrod v. Crossville Motor Services Ltd. \[1953\] 2 All E.R. 753 at pp. 754-755, C.A. where he said:  ""It has often been supposed that the owner of a vehicle is only liable for the negligence of the driver if that driver is his \[p.57\] servant acting in the course of his employment. That is not correct. The owner is also liable if the driver is his agent, that is to say, if the driver is, with the owner's consent, driving the car on the owner's business or for the owner's purposes . . . The law puts an especial responsibility on the owner of a vehicle who allows it to go on the road in charge of someone else, no matter whether it is his servant, his friend, or anyone else. If it is being used wholly or partly on the owner's business or for the owner's purposes, the owner is liable for any negligence on the part of the driver.""  Even if a particular trip is for the servant's own benefit but the master still retains possession and control, that is, in a case where no bailment arises, the master will still be liable, see Rawlings v. Willbye (1954) C.A. 30, c. 91, unreported. At pp. 92-93 the test is formulated that liability depends upon whether the journey as a whole is being undertaken in the interest and for the purpose of the master.  Thus it was that Granville Sharp J.S.C. in Packer v. Sekondi-Takoradi Municipal Council \[1960\] G.L.R. 259 at p. 262, S.C. held that:  ""A servant is presumed to act in the course of his employment unless it can be shown that he acted in his own interest in his use of his master's property, surreptitiously, without the knowledge of his master and independently of orders from any superior whose orders he was bound to obey.""  To the same effect is the case of Mensah v. Dabanka \[1962\] 1 G.L.R. 178, S.C.  In my opinion there has been nothing urged in evidence to rebut the clear fact that at all times relevant to this action the first defendant drove within the scope of his authority and within the course of his employment. His acts and default clearly fix liability on the second defendants, and I so hold.  Now to damages. The plaintiff made a hash at proving special damages. In Bonham Carter v. Hyde Park Hotel Ltd. (1948) 64 T.L.R. 117 at p. 178, Lord Goddard C.J. warned:  ""Plaintiffs must understand that if they bring actions for damages, it is for them to prove their damage; it is not enough to write down the particulars, and, so to speak, throw them at the head of the Court saying: ‘This is what I have lost; I ask you to give me these damages.’ They have to prove it.""  Nevertheless I shall attempt to quantify the damages:  First the loss of earnings. The plaintiff earned averagely �18.00 a month during the period of her pregnancy. For the two months she was actually incapacitated up to date hereof, i.e. for a period of four years six months (54 months), she is entitled to �18 X 54 = �972.00. This amount I award as also �99.00 for hospital and travelling expenses.  \[p.58\]  The plaintiff’s entitlement to general damages regarding prospective loss of earnings, I compute as follows: The plaintiff’s average takings of �18 a month was during the period of her pregnancy only. She claimed �6 to �20 a day when she was not burdened with a child. I thought for a newly fledged seamstress whose own establishment had hardly been opened when she suffered this reverse of an accident her earnings were grossly exaggerated. I think one cedi a day can adequately take care of the lean or off season and the period of bounty, and would be a fairer figure. At 22 the plaintiff might continue to deck prospective clients with fineries for another 23 years or so before matrimonial chores compelled a relinquishment of her trade. With 23 years' purchase consequently I reckon her prospective takings as 365 (less 52 Sundays) (313 days X 1 X 23) = 7,199. This I shall tax down for known contigencies like child birth which her youth would make a demanding and periodic preoccupation, and also for the imponderables of life; the eventual figure should be �3,000.  It should be pointed out that in Kruwah v. Kalmoni \[1961\] 1 G.L.R. 424, Ollennu J. awarded a seamstress whose right arm was virtually useless �G2,000 (�4,000). I have considered �3,000 compensation in the instant case fair as I do not think the plaintiff’s chances of recovering the full use of her hands are completely remote. I must however emphasize that a seamstress like a pianist requires the dedicated use of her fingers. The plaintiff has been deprived of their utility and must be compensated for the loss; in all the circumstances I consider the amount awarded under this head a fair solatium. As to pain and suffering I will award �800.00. The plaintiff must have gone through sheer misery not to talk of the mental anguish she would have experienced at the loss of her child. It is obvious the plaintiff’s enjoyment of life has been reduced considerably by the impairment of her hands. The joy of practising what she had learnt as an apprentice for many years, the chance to create and design clothes, all seem lost. I would consequently award under this head the sum of �200.00. This has been considerably taxed down as in my view this head of damage finds an echo but only an echo, in the general damages awarded.  In the net result I shall award against the defendants jointly and severally in favour of the plaintiff the total sum of five thousand and seventy-one cedis (�5,071.00).  There will be costs for the plaintiff assessed at �100.00.  DECISION  Judgment for the plaintiff.  S.

"JUDGMENT OF EDWARD WIREDU J.  By his writ of summons issued out of this court on 17 February 1971, the plaintiff claims against the defendant as follows:  ""The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for the sum of two thousand new cedis (N�2,000.00) being general damages as a result of the negligence of the defendants which negligence caused the loss of the plaintiff's child whilst in the care of the defendants in December 1969"".  \[p.284\]  The brief facts of this case are that some time in December 1969 the plaintiff's six-week-old daughter fell sick and was taken to the defendant's hospital for treatment where the child was admitted as an in-patient. Because of the age of the child it became necessary for her mother, the plaintiff's first witness, to sleep at the hospital in order to breast feed her. The evidence shows that the child was on admission for about a period of five weeks. Whilst at the hospital the child was kept in the special ward whilst the plaintiff's first witness had to wait at the hospital kitchen with the mothers of the other children who had been admitted for treatment at the hospital. The evidence further shows that the plaintiff's daughter was fed three times a day between the hours of 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. and that the feeding was done by the plaintiff's first witness at the invitation of the hospital staff on duty when it was time to feed the child under the staff's instructions and supervision.  The events which seemed to have sparked off the present litigation are set out in paragraphs (4), (5) and (6) of the statement of claim filed in support of the plaintiff's writ and in paragraphs (1) to (8) of the statement of defence. Paragraphs (1) to (8) of the statement of defence are as follows:  ""(1) On 16 December 1969, the plaintiff's child accompanied by the mother and grandmother was brought to the defendant's hospital.  At the date of admission the child Ekua Asafoakwaa was admitted into the special ward for babies as she was then only two weeks old.  It is not the practice of the defendants to accept babies of that age alone and in accordance with practice the mother of the child stayed with her child from the date of admission to the day when she was reported missing.  Throughout the period of the child's stay at the hospital the mother fed her from the breast at three-hour intervals in common with other inmates.  he nurse on duty, Philomena Andoh, witnessed the mother fed Ekua at midnight on the night of 13 to 14 January, 1970, and later at 3 a.m. on 14 January 1970.  Later at about 5.30 a.m. whilst administering medicines to the children, Nurse Andoh noticed that Ekua was missing from her cot. She immediately went to the kitchen where the mother was and asked her whether the baby was with her. And when she replied in the negative she reported the matter to the matron who later reported the matter to the police.  (7) The police immediately arrived at the hospital and carried out their investigations.  The defendants say that the averments contained in the statement of claim and in particular paragraph (4) are untrue and misleading and flatly denied"".  \[p.285\]  The plaintiff by paragraph (7) of his statement of claim pleaded that the facts of this case fall within the principle of res ipsa loquitur and relies on this principle to establish his claim against the defendants. Issue was joined on this by paragraph (9) of the statement of defence and on 25 June 1971, the following issues were agreed to and set down for trial:  ""(a) Whether or not the safety, medical care and attention of the missing child was the responsibility of the defendants.  (b) Whether or not the disappearance of the said child from the hospital was caused by negligence of the defendants.  (c) Whether or not the plaintiff's plea of res ipsa loquitur as against the defendants is tenable.  (d) Any other issues arising on the pleadings.""  At the trial the plaintiff himself gave evidence and called his wife as his only witness. The defence called no evidence and rested their case on the evidence produced by and on behalf of the plaintiff. The gist of the plaintiff's evidence shows that whilst the child was on admission at the hospital her custody and control were vested in the hospital authorities and that neither himself nor his wife who on the instructions of the hospital authorities had to stay at the precincts of the hospital with the sole purpose of breast feeding her as and when required had access to the child except on the invitation of the hospital authorities. It was therefore the contention of the plaintiff that the defendants were answerable for the loss of the child and he invited me to so hold.  On the facts before me, there is no dispute that when the plaintiff's sick daughter was admitted to the defendants' hospital, the hospital authorities assumed the custody and control of her. The defendants became by law duty bound to ensure the safe custody of her and to deliver her back to the plaintiff whether dead or alive. These duties are imposed on the defendants by their accepting the child into their custody for treatment. A breach therefore of any of these duties would justify an action by the parents of the child, against the defendants provided that they can prove negligence and subsequent loss arising out of it. On the facts of the instant case it is apparently clear that the plaintiff's daughter got missing whilst under the custody and control of the hospital authorities.  The question now is do the present facts justify the plaintiff's reliance on the principle of res ipsa loquitur in establishing his claim against the defendants? On this issue I understand the plaintiff's contention to be that since the custody and control of the child was with the defendants at the material time when she was found to be missing only the employees of the defendant hospital who were with the child at the special ward could tell about the circumstances under which the child disappeared from her cot at a time when she was supposed to be sleeping in it. The circumstances under which the child got missing according to the plaintiff's counsel were a matter within the exclusive knowledge of the defendants' staff on duty at the relevant time. Learned counsel for the \[p.286\] defendants took issue with the plaintiff's reliance on the principle of res ipsa loquitur and submitted that in the absence of any evidence to show that the administrative set up of the defendants' hospital was found wanting in their security system compared with what exists elsewhere in other hospitals the plaintiff's action should be dismissed.  It is trite law that where an event occurs such as would not in the ordinary course of things have occurred without negligence then, conditions exist for the application of res ipsa loquitur. Among the instances of such occurrence is the theft of goods from a bailee's warehouse: see Brooks Wharf and Bull Wharf Ltd. v. Goodman Brothers \[1937\] 1 K.B. 534 at pp. 539-540, C.A. The facts of this case can be likened to a case of bailment. The only difference is that a child cannot strictly be described as a chattel which can be bailed, but the principle I am trying to draw is the same. In matters of care, attention and control of movements a child of six weeks old is no different from an inanimate object which is incapable of independent movement but depends for such support on whoever have its custody. Where therefore the child gets missing whilst under someone's custody conditions exist which require an explanation from whoever had its custody, and on this score I am of the view that the plaintiff's contention that the facts of the present case call for an explanation from the defendant is the right view and that the reliance he places on res ipsa loquitur to establish his claim is justifiable. In my judgment I find res ipsa loquitur applicable to the facts of the present case, and in the absence of any evidence from the defence to show how the child disappeared or to show that the disappearance was consistent with due diligence on their part or that there was no lack of reasonable care on the part of the hospital staff in their custody of the child, I hold the defence liable to the plaintiff in damages.  The next question is what damages is the plaintiff entitled to? This of course must depend on the loss occasioned to him by the negligence of the defendants. Like actions founded on bailments the plaintiff would have been entitled to an order for the delivery of his child or in the alternative its value. To place a monetary value on a human being is against public policy. I think in the circumstances of this case what the plaintiff should be entitled to should have bearing on what he was likely to have gained had the child not disappeared due to the negligent act of the defendants' agents. This must depend on a number of factors such as the age of the child and other similar factors and perhaps the injury to the feelings of the plaintiff. Most of the matters for consideration are matters of conjecture and speculation incapable of any arithmetical calculation and where the need has arisen for the courts to award damages for even loss of parts of human body as a result of negligence they have approached the same by adopting the method of what is fair and just to award having regard to the particular facts of each individual case. Assessment of such awards as are reasonable in the circumstances \[p.28\] of a particular case have never been done in vacuum. I have no precedent to guide me in the present task of trying to find how much is due to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of his daughter through the negligence of the defendants but that is no reason for me to refrain from giving the plaintiff what I consider fair and just for his loss. Doing the best that I can under the present circumstances, I think an award of �650.00 is reasonable and I enter judgement in favour of the plaintiff in that sum. Costs of �105.00 are awarded in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants.  DECISION  Judgment for the plaintiff with costs.

"Criminal law and procedure�Reasons for judgment�Duty of trial magistrate�Failure to make findings of fact and record reasons for judgment convicting accused where defence was corroborated�Whether judgment can stand�Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), s. 177 (1).  HEADNOTES  P.A. and A.F. attended a spiritualist meeting in order that A.F. might be exorcised of evil spirits. The prophetess, the first appellant, fell into a trance in the course of exorcising the spirits and had no recollection of what happened. Evidence led at the trial revealed that A.F. stood naked before the assembled group and made no protest when the prophetess hit her with a stick. There was further evidence, corroborated by two defence witnesses, that P.A. hit the second appellant with a stick, although P.A. swore that the reverse was the truth. The trial magistrate without giving reasons convicted both appellants of assault and battery.  On appeal,  \[p.2\]  Held, allowing the appeal:  (1) by Act 29, s. 86 (1) consent generally negatived any offence of assault and battery if the blows inflicted were in the opinion of the court trifling and not likely to cause bodily harm. The onus of negativing consent which was on the prosecution had not here been discharged. There was also absence of malicious intent. In the circumstances the first appellant was not guilty of any offence against A. F. R. v. Donovan \[1934\] All E.R. Rep. 207, C.C.A. applied.  (2) The trial magistrate failed in discharging the judicial process because he made no findings of fact, neither did he record the reasons for his decision. The version of the defence being corroborated, the case was evenly balanced and the trial magistrate was by Act 30, s. 177 (1) bound to give reasons for accepting the prosecution's version. Craven v.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  APPEALS against convictions for assault and battery entered by a trial magistrate's court. The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgment.  COUNSEL  Dr.Ohene-Djan for the appellants.  Ossei for the respondent.  JUDGMENT OF OSEI-HWERE J.  On 8 March 1974 I allowed this appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellants and substituted an acquittal and discharge and ordered that the fines imposed if paid should be refunded forthwith to the appellants. I reserved my reasons which I now proceed to give. The first and second appellants were jointly charged in count 1 for assaulting one Peter Adjei and the first appellant alone was charged in count 2 for assaulting one Abena Frema. The prosecution's case, in a nutshell, disclosed that the complainants, Peter Adjei and Abena Frema (the first and second prosecution witnesses respectively) had attended a spiritualist meeting which the first appellant had conducted at her house to exorcise evil spirits and that in the course of the meeting the first appellant, who is acknowledged by the group as a prophetess and was therefore the chief actress in the drama, had hit the head of Abena Frema several times with a stick in her effort to exorcise Abena Frema of her evil spirit. The first prosecution witness, Peter Adjei, went and held the stick and the second appellant hit him on the chest and first appellant hit him on the head.  \[p.3\]  The appellants denied the charges. The evidence of the first appellant showed that she had no knowledge of what happened that particular night of the alleged assault. It is also evident from her testimony that when she conducts her prayer meetings she at times falls into a trance when she does not realize what she does or says. The second appellant also relied on his statement to the police. In that statement he said that he was rather the victim of an unprovoked attack from the first prosecution witness Peter Adjei. The statements of both the accused were forwarded together with the record of proceedings. The first appellant's statement to the police supported what she said in the box that when she is filled with the �spirit� at her prayer meetings she does not realize what she does. Two witnesses were called for the defence other than the appellants and they supported the defence contention that the first prosecution witness rather assaulted the appellants. After hearing the evidence from both sides the trial magistrate convicted and sentenced the appellants to a fine of ""�20.00 each or two months' imprisonment with hard labour each."" It is against their conviction and sentence that this appeal is brought.  There were two grounds of appeal filed on the appellants' behalf viz.:  ""(1) That the judgment cannot be supported having regard to the weight of the evidence.  (2) That the magistrate erred in law.""  The judgment was attacked because it contained matters wholly unsupported by any evidence before the court. I entirely agree with the castigations of the appellants' counsel against the judgment. Apart from this, the trial magistrate's statement of the case for the prosecution is nothing short of a hyperbole. Both his statement of the evidence and his undue exaggeration of it must have undoubtedly influenced him in finding the appellants guilty of the charges without giving any consideration to the defence. The defence, as I could see it, is that the second prosecution witness voluntarily attended the first appellant's prayer meeting so that the evil spirit in her would be exorcised. She willingly submitted herself to stand in the nude before the crowd. The second prosecution witness herself offered no resistance when, in the process of casting away the evil spirit, the first appellant had to hit her with the stick. If the second prosecution witness had any objection to raise the only sensible thing she could have done was to have withdrawn herself away from the meeting. There is nothing on record to support the magistrate's statement that the first appellant started to hit the second prosecution witness ""brutally"" and that he, the second prosecution witness suffered any ""brutal ordeal."" By section 86 (1) of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), a person commits an assault and battery when, essentially, there does not exist the other person's consent. Consent, therefore, generally negatives any offence of assault. I say ""generally"" because I concede that the victim's consent cannot be a defence for an assault if the blows inflicted are, in the opinion of the court likely to cause bodily harm. ""Bodily harm,"" of course, \[p.4\] includes, any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim and, although it need not be permanent, it must be more than merely transient and trifling: see R. v. Donovan \[1934\] All E.R. Rep. 207, C.C.A.  Indeed, in R. v. Donovan (supra) the following principles were laid down in the head- note at p. 207:  ""If an act is unlawful in the sense of being in itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be rendered lawful because the person to whose detriment it is done consents to it. No person can license another to commit a crime. So far as the criminal law is concerned, therefore, where the act charged is in itself unlawful - an act malum in se - it can never be necessary for the prosecution to prove absence of consent on the part of the party wronged in order to obtain the conviction of the wrongdoer. There are, however, many acts in themselves harmless and lawful which become unlawful only if they are done without the consent of the person affected, and in such a case the onus of negativing consent is on the prosecution. Consent, being a state of mind, is to be proved or negatived only after a full and careful review of the behaviour of the person who is alleged to have consented. Unless the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of that person has been such that, viewed as a whole, it shows that he or she did not consent, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted.""  If the trial magistrate had directed himself on the definition of assault and battery as contained in section 86 (1) of Act 29 and he had also considered that the first appellant did not commit the act against the second prosecution witness with any hostile intention (in other words, he was not actuated by any malice) and if he had further directed himself on the prosecution's failure to prove the absence of consent he would have come to the conclusion that the first appellant committed no offence at all against the second prosecution witness as she impliedly consented to what she did.  I agree with the second ground of appeal that the trial magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellants as he gave no reasons whatsoever in convicting them. The magistrate, in his judgment, merely stated what he felt was the prosecution's case without giving similar treatment to the case for the defence. He also discredited the supposed alibi pleaded by the second appellant in his statement to the police even though on oath he fully admitted that he was present when the incident took place. He then next concluded his judgment as follows:  ""The evidence of the defence is deplorably weak. There was no collaboration \[sic\] and it merely formed a fantastic mass of lies. In my view the prophetess is only engaged in throwing dust into the eyes of the public and I find both accused guilty of the offence to which the charge relates.""  \[p.5\]  It will be observed that the trial, magistrate failed in discharging the judicial process because he made no findings of fact: see Craven v. Craven (1957) 107 L.J. 505, C.A. applied in Nubuor v. Ampadu, Court of Appeal, 31 May 1960, unreported and Quaye v. Mariamu \[1961\] G.L.R. 93, S.C. In section 177 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), the duty is imposed on a trial magistrate court to ""give its decision in the form of an oral judgment, and . . . record the decision briefly together with the reasons for it, where necessary."" In R. v. Sarpong \[1959\] G.L.R. 383 at p. 386, the Court of Appeal, in reconsidering the similar provision in section 173 of the former Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 10 (1951 Rev.), had this to say:  ""That reasons are necessary even in the case of a magistrate trying a case summarily, unless it is clearly obvious that guilt must be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case. If the reason is not obvious to an appellate Court, then the magistrate must be held to have erred in not stating it, because section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code requires a magistrate to state reasons for his decision 'where necessary'.""  There was ample evidence from the defence that the first prosecution witness was rather the assailant. The corroboration which the magistrate said was lacking was, indeed, supplied by the first and second defence witnesses. As the case for both sides was, as it were, balanced, the trial magistrate was duty bound to have given reasons for accepting the prosecution's case. Criminal convictions cannot be founded on the mere ipse dixit of a trial court. It is for the above reasons that I allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellants and I entered an acquittal and discharge and ordered the fines imposed, if paid, to be refunded forthwith to the appellants.  DECISION  Appeal allowed.  Conviction and sentence set aside.  J.

Damages�Quantum�Personal injuries�Heads eligible for compensation�Regard to be had to damages awarded in comparable cases�Rule that special damages must be pleaded before allowable unjust�Whether rule applicable in this country.  HEADNOTES  The plaintiff (who was, in all other respects, a healthy housewife of nineteen years of age) was referred to the Okomfo Anokye Government Hospital by a private medical practitioner after he had diagnosed a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The doctor in charge of the government hospital, examined the plaintiff and decided that she needed an urgent operation. In the course of the operation (which was successfully carried out) her right arm became swollen and gangrenous, following blood transfusion administered to her by the nursing staff, through a vein in the right arm. The arm was later amputated to save her life. The plaintiff therefore sued the State (represented by the Attorney-General as the nominal defendant) claiming damages for negligence on the part of the hospital staff.  The plaintiff gave the particulars of negligence in her statement of claim and also pleaded that she would ""rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur."" Even though she failed to prove that the particulars of negligence, as pleaded, caused the swelling and the gangrene and the consequent necessity for the amputation, the trial judge found that the facts as proved raised a presumption of negligence, i.e. a case of res ipsa loquitur. The defendant pleaded inter alia, that the plaintiff's action was statute-barred by virtue of section 2 (1) (a) of the Public Officers Act, 1962 (Act 114) (then in force).He, however, led no evidence to show that the injury caused to the plaintiff, happened through no fault of the hospital staff. There was evidence by the plaintiff that she was hospitalised for roughly three months and that after the amputation, she felt pains at the stump of the right arm. She was no longer able to pursue her trade as a seamstress nor to perform \[p.320\] her housewifely duties and to attend to her two infant children. She had to engage the services of a maidservant since her discharge from hospital at the cost of �3.00 a month. In the course of the trial, her customary husband divorced her because of her deformity even though she was still beautiful and charming. She specifically claimed �330.00 being loss of earnings at the rate of �30.00 a month for eleven months. She did not claim the monthly earnings of �30.00 up to the date of trial nor the �3.00 a month which she had to pay to the maidservant. On these facts,  Held:  (1) section 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers Act, 1962 (Act 114), as to immunity from process where an action was brought after the expiration of three months, was inapplicable in actions such as the instant case where the Attorney-General was sued as the nominal defendant for torts committed by servants of the Republic. Konadu v. Attorney-General \[1971\] 1 G.L.R. 130 followed.  (2) In actions, such as the instant case, founded on res ipsa loquitur, it was unnecessary to plead res ipsa loquitur. Facts should rather be pleaded which, taken together, would prove that the injury suffered by the plaintiff, could not have happened but for the presumptive negligence of the defendant.

Klutse, Court of Appeal (full bench), 8 September 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C. 142 applied.  Per curiam. It seems to me ... that the appearance of the mere phrase ""res ipsa loquitur"" is by itself, in fact, no foundation at all for the invocation of the doctrine.  (3) The failure of the plaintiff to prove that the particulars of negligence (as pleaded and proved) caused the gangrene, was not fatal to her claim because the evidence raised a presumption of negligence on the part of the hospital staff, i.e. a case of res ipsa loquitur. Further the expert medical evidence showed that, in all the contingencies, the bacteria which caused the gangrene could only have entered the plaintiff's body if the defendant's servants, namely, the nurses or those in charge of the infusion apparatus, the needle and the drip stand, were prima facie negligent. There was no evidence led to show that the equipment was sterilised, therefore there was no evidence by the defendant to rebut such negligence, and he was liable in damages for the loss caused to the plaintiff on the principle of respondeat superior.

(4) Having regard to damages awarded in comparable cases and to the circumstances of the plaintiff, damages for her injury would be assessed under the following heads, namely:  (a) �330.00 for loss of earnings for eleven months, being special damages specifically pleaded and proved. The monthly earnings in excess of the eleven months' claim, and the expenditure on the maidservant, both up to the date of the trial, would be ignored because they were not specifically pleaded;  (b) �1,500.00 for pain and suffering;  (c) �7,560.00 for loss of future earnings;  (d) �3,000.00 for expenses for maintaining and employing a maid-servant;  \[p.321\]  (e) �2,500.00 for loss of amenities of life; and  (f) �1,200.00 for loss of her marital status and diminution in prospects of remarriage.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  ACTION for damages against the State brought against the Attorney-General as nominal defendant for negligence committed by nursing staff in a government hospital. The facts are fully stated in the judgment.  COUNSEL  D. M. Adusei for the plaintiff.  R. Bruce, State Attorney, for the defendant.  JUDGMENT OF TAYLOR J.  On 28 January 1969, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim in this suit. The action was primarily against the State and so in accordance with the State Proceedings Act, 1961 (Act 51), she did not commence it by the issue of a writ. The relevant paragraphs setting out her claim which was founded on negligence are as follows:  ""(1) The plaintiff is a seamstress and lives at Suame, Kumasi.  (2) On or about 6 May 1967, the plaintiff was admitted to the Okomfo Anokye Hospital for treatment for ectopic \[pregnancy\].  (3) The said hospital is a state-owned hospital maintained and run by the Ghana Government.  (4) From the said date, the hospital per their agents, servants or persons engaged by the defendants did provide for the plaintiff general medical treatment, attendance and advice.  (5) On or about 10 May 1967, the servant or agent or the person engaged by the hospital to treat the plaintiff did give her intravenous infusion near or at the cubital fossa of the right arm but did it negligently and failed to use reasonable care, skill and diligence in or about the treatment, attendance and advice.  (6) As a result of the negligent manner in which the intravenous infusion was given to the plaintiff, the upper right arm got swollen and gangrenous and in consequence thereof the plaintiff lost the said arm.  (7) The loss of the arm sustained by the plaintiff has rendered her incapable of carrying on her work as a seamstress and \[she\] has in consequence suffered loss and damage.  Particulars of Negligence  (8) The servant, agent or the person engaged to give treatment, attendance and advice was negligent in that:  \[p.324\]  (a) The person did not see to it that the blood was running well into the vein;  (b) The person did fail to inquire of the plaintiff whether or not she suffered any pain after putting the needle into her vein.  (c) The plaintiff will further if necessary rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.""  The plaintiff also, inter alia, gave particulars of special damage but this was limited to her loss of professional earnings as a seamstress for eleven months after the injury. She gave no particulars of hospital and other expenses although she led evidence as to such expenses incurred before the trial. These could have been properly pleaded as special damages but they were not so pleaded. I shall advert later to the legal implication of this apparently unfortunate omission to plead what was undoubtedly expenditure legitimately incurred for and on behalf of the plaintiff.  The only other observation I have to make about this statement of claim at this stage is that it would have been very helpful if the age of the plaintiff had been given. At the sitting of the Queen's Bench Division on 1 November 1974 Widgery C.J. gave a Practice Direction reported in \[1974\] 1 W.L. R. 1427, which I think practitioners in Ghana can adopt with profit. It is as follows:  ""In . . . actions for personal injuries there is no obligation to state the age or date of birth of the plaintiff, and this is often omitted. The age of the plaintiff is, however, a vital factor in the assessment of damages in most such cases, and it would be a convenience if this information were contained in the statement of claim. This need not result in additional publicity being given to the plaintiff's age, and, indeed, may have the opposite effect since it will often make it unnecessary for the judge to call for this information in open court.""  On 1 July 1969 in compliance with the procedural provisions of section 1 of the State Proceedings Act, 1961 (Act 51), and in view of the fact that this was essentially a claim against the Republic, the fiat of the Attorney-General was filed in this court and accordingly as from that date this court was clothed with jurisdiction to try this case. Since it involves an allegation of negligence against the servants of the Republic who were running the state-owned Okomfo Anokye Hospital, it is obvious that the liability of the Republic is being invoked in view of its ordinary status as an employer or master. The liability is therefore merely vicarious and founded on the well-known principle of general application compressed in the Latin phrase respondeat superior and meaning that a master is liable for the negligence of his servant committed in the course of their employment. The principle was succinctly stated over a 100 years ago in Bayley v. Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Co. (1872) L. R. 7 C. P. 415 at p. 42.) by Willes J.:  \[p.325\]  ""A person who puts another in his place to do a class of acts in his absence, necessarily leaves him to determine, according to the circumstances that arise, when an act of that class is to be done, and trusts him for the manner in which it is done; and consequently he is held answerable for the wrong of the person so intrusted either in the manner of doing such an act, or in doing such an act under circumstances in which it ought not to have been done; provided that what was done was done, not from any caprice of the servant, but in the course of the employment.""  (The emphasis is mine.) There used to be some doubts as to whether this principle applied to the negligent acts of the professional staff of hospitals. The doubts were generated by the unsatisfactory decisions of Kennedy and Farwell L.JJ. (concurred in by Cozens-Hardy M.R.) in Hillyer v. St. Bartholomew's Hospital (Governors) \[1909\] 2 K.B. 820, C.A. These doubts, however, have been set to rest in Gold v. Essex County Council \[1942\] 2 K.B. 293, C.A. which will be dealt with later in this judgment. Indeed in Cassidy v. Ministry of Health \[1951\] 1 All E.R. 574, C.A. (a case not unlike this case) the general principle thus enunciated by Willes J. in the Bayley case (supra) was restated and applied with full force by the Court of Appeal in England to the professional staff of a hospital.  I must draw attention here to the fact that the Attorney-General in this case before me is merely a nominal defendant having regard to the provisions of section 10 (2) of the State Proceedings Act, 1961 (Act 51); in other words although the Attorney-General is himself a servant of the Republic it is not his acts or omissions which are being called in question in this litigation. This point is very important and I have adverted to it because in a statement of defence filed, the Attorney-General, as the nominal defendant, apart from denying liability on behalf of the Republic and explaining that the plaintiff developed gas gangrene in the right forearm after she had had intravenous infusion at the state-owned Okomfo Anokye Hospital, alleged as an apparent answer to paragraph (8) of the statement of claim, that the transfused blood went into the proper vessel, namely, a vein and that the right forearm became swollen and gangrenous because of thrombosis of the main artery and veins of that limb - a development which he alleged was unconnected with the transfusion. And he pleaded, inter alia, ""The plaintiff's action against the defendant is statute-barred by virtue of the Public Officers Act, 1962 (Act 114)."" This plea is becoming common in cases in which the Attorney-General represents the Republic. It is time its precise scope was properly defined and delimited. In my view in all cases in which the Attorney-General is a nominal defendant this plea is misconceived. The relevant provision of the Public Officers Act, 1962 (then in force) was section 2 (1) (a), and it provided as follows:  ""2. (1) Where any action, prosecution, or other proceeding is commenced against any person for any act done in pursuance or execution or intended execution of any enactment or of any public duty or authority or in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the \[p.326\] execution of any such enactment, duty, or authority, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say-  (a) the action, prosecution, or proceeding shall not lie or be instituted unless it is commenced within three months next after the act, neglect, or default complained of, or in the case of a continuance of injury or damage, within three months next after the ceasing thereof.""  As I have indicated already the substantive defendant in this suit is the Government of Ghana and this of course is the reason for the fiat.  Proceeding under Order 25, r. 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, counsel for the plaintiff moved this court for leave to argue as a preliminary point of law ""whether or not the plaintiff's action is statute-barred""; thereupon the defendant's counsel peremptorily abandoned this defence. Well may he do so for in a similar situation in the case of Konadu v. Attorney-General \[1971\] 1 G.L.R. 130, Aboagye J. relying on the United Kingdom cases of Broom v. Morgan \[1953\] 1 Q.B. 597, C.A. and Midland Silicones Ltd. v. Scruttons Ltd. \[1961\] 1 Q.B. 106, C.A. (cases whose ratio can hardly be faulted) refused to follow his previous decision in Buobuh v. Minister of Interior \[1971\] 1 G.L.R. 127 where he had held that this defence was maintainable, and expressed a view at p. 133 with which I am in entire agreement. He said:  ""The Republic of Ghana is certainly not a public officer and ... it cannot to borrow the words of Singleton L.J. in Broom v. Morgan, hide behind the skirts of the immunity of its servants.""  With the issue of the immunity of the Republic so disposed of, I hope the ghost of the plea will forever rest in peace. With the plea off the arena, the substantive issues, which on the summons for directions were ultimately submitted for trial, are as follows:  ""(1) Whether or not the defendant's servants or agents were negligent in treating or attending the plaintiff.  (2) Whether or not the plaintiff's arm was amputated as a result of the development of gangrene.  (3) Whether or not the development of gangrene, if any, was due to the negligent manner in which the defendant performed the transfusion.  (4) Whether or not the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable.""  The fourth issue was considered necessary in the circumstance because the plaintiff specifically pleaded in her paragraph (9) that she would rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.  It has been fashionable in some personal injury claims founded on negligence to plead res ipsa loquitur. Indeed in Bullen and Leake's Precedents of pleadings (11th ed.) at p. 536, there is a suggestion that it is proper to plead res ipsa loquitur in certain cases and in fact in Nelson v. Klutse, Court of Appeal, 8 September 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C. 142, this point regarding pleading res ipsa loquitur and the treatment of \[p.327\] that plea in Bullen and Leake was urged on the Court of Appeal in an argument calculated to show that failure to allege res ipsa loquitur in a statement of claim disbars the plaintiff from relying on the doctrine. In obiter dicta, Amissah J.A. considered the matter thus:  ""Our attention was drawn in this respect to the precedent in Bullen and Leake's Precedents of Pleadings (11th ed.) at pp. 535-536 where a sentence is added to indicate that the plaintiff will rely on the maxim. A set of pleadings is not necessarily bad because it fails to come up to the standard of Bullen and Leake. And though the pleadings of the applicant quoted above may not reach the heights of perfection the question is whether, if one may borrow the words of Lord Normand in Esso Petroleum Co., Ltd. y. Southport Corporation \[1956\] A.C. 218 at p. 238, H.L., they gave fair notice of the case which has to be met so that the opposing party may direct his evidence to the issue disclosed by them'.""  The idea that res ipsa loquitur as such is pleadable must have probably arisen ex abundanti cautela because of the caution of pleaders. In Benas and Essenhigh's Precedents of Pleadings (2nd ed.), one of the specimen statements of claim in negligence contains this at p. 236, ""In regard to each of the Defendants the Plaintiff will rely on the principle of res ipsa loquitur-. And at p. 536 of Bullen and Leake referred to by Amissah J.A. in Nelson v. Klutse (supra), the following appears in a specimen, ""So far as may be necessary, the plaintiff will rely upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur . . .""  In my opinion, the editors of Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh are entirely wrong. Order 19, r. 4 of our High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, which was culled without any alteration in form or substance from the English Rules provides as follows:  ""Every pleading shall contain, and contain only a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved ...""  (The emphasis is mine.) This provision makes it mandatory that only material facts and nothing else are to be pleaded. In my view paragraph (9) of the statement of claim ought to be struck off and I propose to ignore it as being unnecessary having regard to the provision of Order 19, r. 29, which provides as follows:  ""The Court or a Judge may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any indorsement or pleading which may be unnecessary...""  It seems to me that what ought to be pleaded in these res ipsa loquitur cases is not the mere words ""res ipsa loquitur""; incantatory words as Amissah J.A. called them in Nelson v. Klutse (supra.); these words by themselves do not in any way advance the narrative of the plaintiff's case. Facts should rather be pleaded which taken together prove that the damage suffered by the plaintiff could not have happened but for the presumptive \[p.328\] negligence of the defendant. In fact in these res ipsa loquitur cases what actually contributed to the damage is unknown to the plaintiff since he was not in control of the res. The person in control of the res is the defendant and because being in control, the damage or injury ought not to have happened if he exercised care and diligence, an onus is cast on him to show that the damage was not caused by his negligence or the negligence of his servant.  This is the legal and commonsense approach to the problem which commends itself to me and which finds support in the views of Davies L.J. in the English case of Bennett v. Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd. \[1971\] 3 All E.R. 822 at p. 825, C.A. Commenting on the necessity for pleading res ipsa loquitur he said at p. 825:  ""I have said that in my opinion it is not necessary to plead res ipsa loquitur. If the facts pleaded and the facts proved show that the cause of the accident was apparently and on its face some negligence, that is sufficient.""  With regard to the onus of proof in such a situation he remarked at the same page:  ""If the accident is proved to have happened in such a way that prima facie it could not have happened without negligence on the part of the defendants, then it is for the defendants to explain and show how the accident could have happened without negligence.""  The decision itself of the full bench of the Court of Appeal in Nelson v. Klutse (supra) supports the view that res ipsa loquitur need not be pleaded, for Amissah J.A., who delivered the unanimous decision of the court, explained the position rather carefully:  ""We do not share their view that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be resorted to only when a plaintiff specifically pleads that he intends to rely on it. What the passage in Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd ed.), Vol. 28, p. 77, para. 79, which was cited by learned counsel to us, says is not that res ipsa loquitur must be pleaded, but that facts from which it is intended that the presumption should be drawn must be. The actual words of Halsbury are: \`The plaintiff cannot rely upon an inference of negligence unless he has alleged in the pleadings and proved at the trial the facts from which the inference is to be drawn.' So that the appearance of the incantatory words \`res ipsa loquitur' in the pleadings, or the plaintiff saying therein that he intends to rely on the mere accident as proof of the negligence, is not the only foundation for the invocation of the doctrine.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  It seems to me with respect though that the appearance of the mere phrase ""res ipsa loquitur"" is by itself, in fact, no foundation at all for the invocation of the doctrine. In my view the true foundation for the invocation of the doctrine is as clearly stated in the above passage. It is merely pleading and nothing else, only ""the facts from which it is intended that the presumption should be drawn."" Unfortunately probably the cautious \[p.329\] way in which it was expressed has inadvertently, I believe, led an academic writer to misconceive the true ratio decidendi and to suggest in the usual vein of academic writers but very wrongly in my view, that the decision of the full bench in applying the principle to the case is hard to justify. In a comment in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at pp. 74-75 the writer noted:  ""the case before the full bench of the Court of Appeal reduced itself simply to this: Did the plaintiff's pleadings give \`fair notice' to the defendants that res ipsa loquitur would be invoked?""  This is obviously a wrong appraisal of the case which the court had to contend with. I would have thought the case rather reduced itself to this: Did the plaintiff by his pleadings give fair notice to the defendants of the facts on which his negligence actual or presumptive is based? Res ipsa loquitur after all means as Lord Shaw put it in Ballard v. North British Railway Co. 1923,, S.C. (H.L.) 43 at p. 56, that the thing that had happened, the subject-matter of the plaintiff's complaint ""tells its own story."" In other words it thus means merely that the thing speaks for itself. What is it that speaks for itself? It is the facts and circumstances of the case taken together that figuratively speak of negligence. Consequently to introduce res ipsa loquitur in pleadings in the manner done by Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh and as was done in this case means no more than that at the trial the plaintiff intends to argue that the facts he will produce are prima facie evidence of negligence. In other words contrary to the provision of Order 19, r. 4 he is pleading argument not facts. Now in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali's Civil Procedure in British India (2nd ed.), the editors commenting on the corresponding provision in the India Civil Code noted at p. 701 that, ""Modern pleadings are merely concise statements of the facts. Inference of law should not be pleaded. Pleadings should not contain mere arguments."" (The emphasis is mine.)  In the light of all this it is obvious that the following advice proffered by the writer in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at p. 75 can hardly be said to be useful:  ""Where counsel is in the slightest doubt as to whether his pleadings disclose the invocation of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, he will be wise to plead it specifically. If by any reason of omission or default he is not able to do so at the very beginning of the case, he would be well advised to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to amend his pleadings so as to indicate clearly that res ipsa loquitur is in issue.""  I think I have canvassed this matter at length to show that the mere words ""res ipsa loquitur"" ought not to be pleaded in any way, certainly not in the manner in which it appears here and in Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh.  In this case before me the plaintiff gave evidence and called three witnesses. The first witness was her husband, the second her husband's father and the third was the doctor who referred her to the Okomfo Anokye Hospital. Her evidence is that she is a seamstress and that some time in 1967 when she was nineteen years old she became pregnant and \[p.330\] in the second month of her pregnancy she developed pains in her stomach. Although she was conscious she could not speak and her husband took her to a private hospital at Suame junction. She was examined by the physician-in-charge who decided to refer her to the Okomfo Anokye Hospital. At the hospital the doctor in charge examined her and decided that she needed an urgent operation. She was taken to the theatre and the necessary preparations were made for the operation, and from this stage she did not know what happened to her. Apparently she was put under anaesthesia and when she regained consciousness, she realised that she had been operated upon on the lower abdomen. She also saw near her bed a blood transfusion apparatus and two lady nurses in attendance on her. She also found that the needle end of the apparatus was in her right arm and she felt pains. This was the next day after the operation although by this time the pains in her stomach had somewhat subsided. She said she felt pains in her right arm and she could not talk and so she made a signal with her left hand to draw the attention of the nurses to her as the two of them were then leaving her bedside. According to her evidence, one nurse came back and changed the position of the needle in her arm after which she fell asleep. She said while in the hospital she was part of the time conscious and at other times unconscious and so she did not see everything that happened to her. However, when she woke up she noticed that there were four needle marks on her arm. The arm was swollen and she was in great pain. She also noticed that the blood from the blood infusion apparatus was not going well into her vein but was rather flowing onto the ground. She said the blood from the apparatus was stagnant in her arm and in her opinion was thus causing the swelling and was overflowing by the point of the needle. She complained and the senior medical officer in charge, Dr. Armar, was called. He ordered that the transfusion should be stopped at once and later in consultation with four other doctors, he told her that her right arm had to be amputated. She objected and pointed out that she came to the hospital with stomach pains and she did not see its connection with her arm to justify amputation. The doctors, however, insisted that the amputation was necessary to save her life and so her relatives consented to the amputation and her arm was accordingly amputated a few inches above the elbow. She said when she regained consciousness after the amputation she felt great pains in the amputated stump of the arm. She was on admission in the hospital for three months and a day before she was discharged.  Her husband, the plaintiff's first witness, corroborated her evidence in material particulars up to the stage when she had the operation on the lower abdomen. After the operation he said he saw her in the ward. She was then receiving blood transfusion and moving her head from side to side apparently in pain. He said he noticed that the apparatus was not working well as the blood was not dripping into the tube and so he called the attention of the nurses. One of the nurses followed him to the plaintiff's bedside and there the said nurse opened a clip at the end of the rubber tube portion of the apparatus and he noticed that the blood had started to flow but when she released the clip the blood flow stopped. When the \[p.331\] flow stopped, the nurse held the plaintiff's right arm and took off the plaster on her arm and she removed the needle from her arm and cleaned the wound on her arm and then inserted the needle in another part of the arm. This took place on the day the plaintiff was admitted, that is, Saturday, 6 May 1967. His further evidence is that as the apparatus was defective the nurse asked him to endeavour to buy a rubber hose and dextrose at a store at Bantama to which she directed him. He did buy these things and tendered one in evidence but as they were not actually used their only relevance in my finding is to lend credence to his version of what took place before the nurses and to show in particular that his version that the nurses said the apparatus was defective is in all probability true; otherwise I do not see why he should incur on his own, the expense of buying dextrose and a rubber hose for the infusion apparatus. On Sunday, 7 May 1967, he visited the hospital during visiting hours and he found that the plaintiff's arm was red looking and swollen.  On Monday, 8 May 1967, he visited the plaintiff in the hospital twice, once in the morning and again at 4.30 p.m. On this occasion, he noticed that the area of the arm around the needle had become dark but the rest of the arm was red. The arm was more greatly swollen than he saw on Sunday. On Tuesday, 9 May 1967, he visited the plaintiff in the morning and he noticed that the needle had now been removed from her arm. In the afternoon when he visited the plaintiff he found that her arm had been wrapped with cotton wool and the cotton wool was soaked with blood. He found his wife groaning and weeping and in great pain. At 4.30 p.m. on the same Tuesday he found when he visited the plaintiff in the hospital that her arm was ""swollen very greatly beyond expression"" and the whole arm had become dark including even the palm. On Wednesday, 10 May, between 5.30 a.m. and 6.00 a.m. he again visited the plaintiff. He found the plaintiff asleep. The size of the arm was the same as on Tuesday but it had gone even darker like roasted plantain and was giving out bad odour. On this day, he was informed that the plaintiff's arm had to be amputated to save her life and on the same day the arm was amputated. After the amputation, he wrote to the hospital authorities seeking an explanation as to why he sent his wife there for the treatment of stomach pains but they rather amputated her arm. According to his evidence, he and his father, the plaintiff's second witness, had a conference with Dr. Armar, the senior medical officer in charge, and another doctor and at the conference, Dr. Armar told him that what had happened was a mistake and that he would write to his head office in Accra for an artificial limb and compensation for the plaintiff. This evidence of the husband regarding the conference and the admission of mistake by the hospital authorities and the promise of compensation was fully corroborated by the second witness for the plaintiff who was present at the meeting. With regard to the meeting and what took place, it is significant that in cross-examination, although counsel for the defendant conceded that there was a meeting and suggested to the plaintiff (a suggestion which was vehemently denied) \[p.332\] that Dr. Armar did not admit any mistake nor agree to arrange for compensation, nevertheless Dr. Armar was never called by the defendant.  The third and last witness for the plaintiff was Dr. F. I. Amponsah; he was the physician in the Suame private hospital who saw the plaintiff and referred her to the Okomfo Anokye Government Hospital. According to his evidence, when he saw the plaintiff she had nothing whatsoever wrong with her arm. He diagnosed a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy and this was why he referred her to the government hospital. The substantive portion of the evidence of the plaintiff and her witnesses set down above was not impaired in any way at all in cross-examination. The plaintiff was clearly in the hands of the hospital staff, the doctor and the nurses, and her account of what happened to her was corroborated by the evidence of her husband. That account it seems to me must be true as no contrary version was pressed on her by the defence. Furthermore, it is amply supported by the obvious fact that her arm had indeed been amputated. I believe her evidence and that of her witnesses and I accept it as constituting the case which the plaintiff made in this court. A short synopsis of the case consistent with the evidence and devoid of irrelevant material likely to cloud the issues will be useful having regard to the fact that the claim is founded on negligence. The case briefly is that the plaintiff who was in all other respects healthy developed a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and was given in charge to the professional staff of the Okomfo Anokye Hospital run by the government. While she was thus under their care and treatment in the hospital her right arm became swollen and gangrenous following a blood transfusion she received in the said arm and the arm had to be amputated to save her life. Before going to the hospital however her arm was perfectly normal.  Although the plaintiff gave in paragraph (8) of her statement of claim (already referred to) some particulars of alleged negligent acts and led evidence which was not challenged in support thereof and which I therefore believe and accept indicating that at one stage of her treatment the blood from the apparatus did not go into her vein but was stagnant in her arm, no doubt because the nursing staff were not keeping an eye on the apparatus and its effectiveness, nevertheless no expert medical evidence was called by the plaintiff to connect this with the swelling and the gangrene and the consequent necessity for the amputation. In the circumstances I hold that the particulars of negligent conduct alleged in paragraph (8) and proved to my satisfaction by the plaintiff have not been shown to be the cause of the injury. The reason for this has been long recognised in this area of the law. In Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (13th ed.) at p.457 the editors elicited from the decided authorities four ingredients of primary liability in negligence as follows:  ""(1) A duty of care situation, ie., recognition by law that the careless infliction of the kind of damage in suit on the type of person to which the plaintiff belongs by the type of person to which the defendant belongs is actionable.  (2) Foreseeability that the defendant's conduct would have inflicted on the plaintiff the kind of damage in suit. (This is what is implied in the statement that the duty of care has to \[p.333\] be \`wed' to the plaintiff.).  (3) Proof that the defendant's conduct was careless, i.e., that it failed to measure up to the standard and scope set by law: breach of duty.  (4) There must be a causal connection between the defendant's carelessness and the damage.  (The emphasis is mine.)  It is the fourth ingredient stated above, the causal connection, that is missing in the negligence alleged to arise by virtue of the particulars contained in paragraph (8). Thus Lord Blackburn in one of the early cases on the problem, Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson (1877) 3 App.Cas. 193 at p. 208, H.L. highlighted the principle when he said:  ""My Lords, in all cases of actions to recover damages for a personal injury . . . the Plaintiff has to prove, first, that there was on the part of the Defendants a neglect of that duty cast upon them under the circumstances; and, second, that the damage he has sustained was the consequence of that neglect of duty.""  (The emphasis is mine.) And in the same case at p. 198 Lord Cairns L.C. stated it in very clear language:  ""The negligence must in some way connect itself, or be connected by evidence, with the accident . . . In the present case there was no doubt negligence in the company's servants . . . but there is nothing, in my opinion, in this negligence which connects itself with the accident which took place.""  (The emphasis is mine.) And the duty of the plaintiff in such a situation adverted to by Lord Blackburn and the reason for the rule were further explained by that great law Lord, Lord Watson in Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co. (1886) 12 App.Cas. 41 at p. 47, H.L. as follows:  ""Mere allegation or proof that the company were guilty of negligence is altogether irrelevant; they might be guilty of many negligent acts or omissions, which might possibly have occasioned injury to somebody, but had no connection whatever with the injury for which redress is sought, and therefore the plaintiff must allege and prove, not merely that they were negligent, but that their negligence caused or materially contributed to the injury.""  In Ghana Azu Crabbe J.A. (as he then was) adverted to this matter in Sarpong v. Fibre-Bag Manufacturing Co., Court of Appeal, 27 November 1967, unreported; digested in (1968) C.C, 33, hereinafter referred to as the Fibre-Bag case when he said, ""the plaintiff must prove not only negligence or breach of duty, but that the fault of the defendant caused or substantially contributed to his injury."" (The emphasis is mine.) I apprehend that the requirement that the fault should have ""substantially contributed to"" or as Lord Watson would have it ""materially contributed to"" the injury, is meant to cover cases of contributory negligence. It \[p.334\] follows therefore from these authorities, that as the plaintiff has failed to connect the negligence alleged in paragraph (8) with the injury she suffered the particularised negligence has not been proved to be either the cause or the substantial cause of the injury.  Although she has failed to prove that the particularised negligence caused the gangrene this is by no means the end of the matter. In Nelson v. Klutse (supra), the full bench of the Court of Appeal had also to contend (in their review of the decision of the erstwhile Supreme Court) with the case of a plaintiff who had failed to prove the particulars of negligence set down in the pleadings but who had nevertheless proved facts which raise a prima facie case of negligence for the defendant to answer. The failure to substantiate the particulars pleaded was held not to be fatal to the claim if the other facts proved raise a presumption of negligence. Amissah J.A. delivering the unanimous decision of the full bench reversing the contrary view of the Supreme Court said:  ""The view taken by the majority of the Supreme Court was that the applicant had to establish these allegations especially as particularised and that having failed to do so, the defendants were entitled to judgment. While not disputing this statement as a general principle, it appears to us that in certain respects the approach of the majority to the problem was faulty. They seem to have taken the view that the itemisation of the particulars of negligence meant that the applicant claimed to know exactly how the accident occurred and that this claim was incompatible with reliance on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.""  And it was held by the full bench of the court that although the particulars have not been proved, nevertheless, the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the other facts proved to found her claim. On these facts, since they establish a prima facie case of negligence, she was held entitled to recover unless the defendant rebutted the presumption.  In the case before me, I think I can as a matter of common sense take judicial notice of the fact that persons who go to hospitals with stomach ailment do not end up with their arms amputated. It is not part of the treatment. Indeed even a very cursory examination of the evidence of the plaintiff shows clearly that at least something must have gone wrong in the hospital and that that something must be in the peculiar knowledge of the defendant's servants. The circumstance further shows that prima facie that something which went wrong ought not to have gone wrong if those in charge of the plaintiff had not been at some fault of a sort, for prima facie there ought not to be any reason why stomach pains should end up in amputation.  In my view the facts of this case therefore raise a typical case of res ipsa loquitur and so at the close of the case for the plaintiff the legal position as I conceive it is that an onus was cast on the defendant of showing that the gas gangrene developed and the amputation therefore became necessary through no fault of the doctors and nurses or those persons who took charge of the plaintiff. This view of the law finds \[p.335\] considerable support in a highly illuminating and authoritative exposition in the decision on review of the full bench of the Court of Appeal in in Nelson v. Klutse (supra).In that case Amissah J.A. (reading the unanimous judgment of the court) made reference to the judgment of Evatt J. in the Australian case of Davis v. Bunn (1956) 56 C.L.R. 246 and then set out in simple language to indicate in a most lucid and in his usually able manner the scope and operation of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. He explained carefully:  ""According to our understanding of the doctrine it applies whenever it can be said at a given point of a trial that the res or circumstances proved by the plaintiff are of themselves sufficient evidence from which negligence may reasonably be inferred. And the first decisive point of the trial is the close of the plaintiff's case. For if the doctrine can then be invoked by him, he is enabled to avoid a non-suit or his action being dismissed on the ground that he had not discharged the onus which lay on him ... In effect what this boils down to is that in every case of negligence it is for the plaintiff to plead and prove facts from which the negligence of the defendant may be inferred by the court. Generally, proof of the act or omission which occasions damage is not by itself sufficient evidence from which the inference of negligence can be drawn. For the mere fact that damage results from an act does not make the act a negligent act. The facts and circumstances which make each particular act or omission negligent must be proved. And the onus of doing so rests with the plaintiff. But there are cases where the proof of the act itself, let us say an accident, is sufficient to raise the inference of negligence because acts or omissions of that nature do not in the ordinary course of things occur without the negligence of the person responsible for them happening. These are the cases where it is said that the res speaks for itself. Where proof is given by the plaintiff of such an accident by itself and no more, the court is entitled to infer negligence unless there is an explanation from the defendant as to how it occurred which is consistent with the defendant not being negligent. Upon the explanation being given, the court is put in the position where it has all the facts before it and its conclusion as to negligence vel non would be drawn from an assessment of all the material before it.""  This clear and unimpeachable statement of the legal position is supported by the later English case of Bennett v. Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd. already referred to. Coming as it does from the full bench of the Court of Appeal, it is ""for the moment the last word on this aspect of res ipsa loquitur"" in Ghana to borrow the words of Francois J. (as he then was) in Agogro v. Ago \[1973\] 1 G.L.R. 45 at p. 52. The Bennett case above and the statement of Amissah J.A. above indicate or give a guideline as to the proper approach of trial courts to the question of the burden of proof in res ipsa loquitur cases and the proper assessment of the material offered in evidence by the plaintiff and the defendant. That \[p.336\] being so it is necessary to examine the case of the defendant to see what answer was offered, for, as I have already indicated, in my finding at the end of the case for the plaintiff, the evidence which I accept established a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant. The case in fact as I have already said is a typical res ipsa loquitur case and in accordance with Amissah J.A.'s guideline in Nelson v. Klutse (supra) I propose to examine the material evidence led by the defendant in purported rebuttal.  The defendant called only three witnesses: the surgeon, Dr. Poku, who did the operation, the surgical specialist, Dr. Lahiri, who amputated the plaintiff's arm and the pathologist, Dr. Marbell, who examined the amputated arm. As I have already pointed out, none of the nurses said to be in attendance at the relevant time was called. The surgeon's evidence was that when the plaintiff was referred to him he found that she had a bulky uterus and on examination he diagnosed a case of ruptured ectopic gestation which in simple language means that she was pregnant but the pregnancy did not occur in the right place; the result was that the pregnancy had burst causing a rupture of the tube in which the foetus was lying. He gave instructions to the nursing staff that she be blood-grouped and cross-matched for two pints of blood. On account of her condition, he instructed further that resuscitating measures be started at once by giving her drips. He said drips are normally given by the doctors-in-charge, but in this country because of shortage of doctors, the nursing staff are trained to do it if the doctor-in-charge is unable, due to pressure of work, to do it himself. In the instant case he was hard pressed since he had another patient lying on the theatre table ready for an operation.  I must remark at this stage that since the particular nurses were not called, no evidence was led to show that they had in fact undergone the necessary training qualifying them to give the drips in the place of the doctor. According to the further evidence of the doctor, he gave further instructions to the nurses to prepare the plaintiff for laparotomy, that is, the opening up of the abdominal cavity and to bring the plaintiff to the theatre when the preparations and all his instructions have been carried out. This was done and when the plaintiff was brought to the theatre he found that the drip had been set in accordance with his instructions and it was running well. The drip given was five per cent dextrose in normal saline and it was given as is normal in such cases into a vein in her right arm. At the theatre the plaintiff had anaesthesia and he opened up her abdominal cavity and found therein about two to three pints of blood which had accumulated there due to the ruptured tub . He said he cut off the ruptured tube and sutured it. He then scooped the blood and used it to replace the dextrose saline. The operation was successful and he had her returned to the ward with the blood drip on. This was on Saturday, 6 May 1967, the same day she was referred to the hospital. On the next day following the operation, he found that her condition was not improving and since she had finished taking the blood drip, he instructed that she should be put on the dextrose drip again and this was done. On 8 May 1967, he found that the condition of the plaintiff \[p.337\] had improved and so he instructed that the drip should be discontinued and it was accordingly discontinued. On 9 May 1967, he found that her right arm was swollen and cold and he could not feel her radial pulse. On account of this, he asked the surgical specialist, the defendant's second witness, for an opinion. On examining the plaintiff the surgical specialist Dr. Lahiri diagnosed a case of gas gangrene and advised amputation to save the plaintiff's life. This was accordingly done on 10 May 1967. This is virtually his evidence-in-chief. I shall later on deal with his admissions in cross-examination which are germane to the question of negligence vel non. Dr. Lahiri corroborated the evidence relating to the reference for his opinion and since the relevant portion of his evidence was accepted by all parties I set it hereunder:  ""The plaintiff clearly had gas gangrene and the organism responsible for this must come from outside into the body. Gas gangrene is caused by anaerobic organisms called clostridium welshii, clostridium oedemateans and clostridium septigue. These are the three main bacteria which are responsible for causing gas gangrene. In the case of the plaintiff, in the absence of any other lacerated wound on the arm, it is my opinion that the bacteria got into the body by the possible route of entry, namely, through the needle for the drip set. If the needle is sterilized then it is not possible for the bacteria to get in through the needle but of course if the drip itself is contaminated or its container is contaminated, then although the needle is sterilized the bacteria may nevertheless get into the body.""  The pathologist, Dr. Marbell, who was called as the third and last witness for the defendant, corroborated Dr. Lahiri's evidence. He explained further that because gas gangrene is caused by anaerobic organisms which grow without air, if there is a scratch or wound on the skin and these organisms settle there, it is not likely that they will cause gas gangrene. In order to cause gas gangrene they must be deep in the body tissue where they will have no oxygen. He said the blood normally contains a lot of oxygen and so the gas gangrene causing bacteria will normally not be able to establish in the blood stream. Indeed in a healthy person according to his evidence, oxygen is supplied to all parts of the body and so even if the gas gangrene causing bacteria is introduced into healthy tissue, gas gangrene will not normally develop unless the tissues are dead and they may be dead if in the process of introducing the bacteria, the tissues are damaged. He said that the needle used for blood and dextrose transfusion can cause damage to the tissues at its path and he gave his opinion as to the cause of the gas gangrene in this case:  ""In my opinion, I think the infection started from a puncture in the arm at which the organisms settled and when conditions were ripe they began to multiply and establish themselves.""  And he added,""If the needle is properly sterilized no bacteria can survive."" Dr. Lahiri and Dr. Marbell to be satisfactory witnesses anxious to tell the truth and to help the court to come to a just decision. Not so \[p.338\] with the surgeon, Dr. Poku. His evidence which is completely contradicted by the medical evidence of the two very experienced senior doctors, Dr. Marbell and Dr. Lahiri, would seem to be that the plaintiff's arm became swollen and gangrenous because of thrombosis of the vein. Under cross-examination as to how the gas gangrene was caused, he said he suspected that thrombosis of the vessels set in first thus creating an anaerobic condition and consequently the setting in of the gas gangrene. When asked how the bacteria could have got into the body he replied, ""This is the mystery.""  It seems to me from the totality of the evidence that I must reject the suggestion of Dr. Poku, a medical man, that the bacteria got into the body of the plaintiff in a mysterious way. As a court of law and a tribunal dealing with facts, I am afraid, I must have no truck with the mysterious. The medical evidence adduced by the defendant shows in my view very clearly that there was nothing mysterious about how the bacteria entered the arm of the plaintiff.  From the totality of the medical evidence one can reasonably reconstruct the probable causes of the gas gangrene like a logical syllogism: In this connection it must be remembered that the only openings in the plaintiff's arm were the four puncture marks of the needle inserted into her arm by the defendant's servants when they gave her the drips intravenously. As Dr. Marbell pointed out, in the process of inserting the needle into the arm, some damage was necessarily done to the tissues. Now the medical evidence is that the bacteria is foreign to the body and must come from outside. It can only thrive in anaerobic conditions very deep in the body tissue. Since the tissues had been damaged by the needle, if care was not taken to revive them, they would die. Such dead tissues would have no oxygen and since they would be deep in the body with no oxygen the anaerobic condition would be created. If the needle was then contaminated the bacteria could settle and cause gas gangrene. On the other hand, if the needle were not contaminated but the apparatus, that is, the drip container were contaminated, then if the flow into the blood stream was not impeded there would be no gas gangrene since there would be sufficient oxygen in the blood stream and there would be no anaerobic condition in the blood stream; but if the blood or the dextrose did not flow into the blood stream but rather went into the dead tissue as the plaintiff alleged, then the bacteria could also settle down and cause gas gangrene. As the expert evidence of Dr. Lahiri and Dr. Marbell shows, if the apparatus, that is, the container of the drip and the needle were sterilized, it would be impossible for gas gangrene to develop unless the dextrose drip or the blood given were also contaminated.  The above analysis shows the various alternative ways through which the bacteria in this case could have got into the body and in all the contingencies, they could only get into the body if the servants of the defendant, namely, the nurses or those who had the care and custody of the infusion apparatus, the needle, the dextrose and the blood drip were prima facie guilty of negligence, and it is significant none of these persons were \[p.339\] called. The surgeon, Dr. Poku, merely gave instructions to the nurses and presumably took it for granted that as they were probably trained nurses, they would carry out their duties without negligence. These nurses, as I have said, were not called so that they could be examined and cross-examined as to the nature of their training and the manner in which they carried out their instructions.  This brings me at once to the question of the nature of the duty which hospital authorities, be they government or private and their professional staff, namely, the doctors and particularly the nurses and other servants, owe to patients who call for treatment or are admitted for treatment in their hospitals. This is the first time I believe the problem has come to the courts in contentious litigation in this country. The matter was considered at length in England in Gold v. Essex County Council \[1942\] 2 K.B. 293, C.A. In that case counsel for the plaintiff, Denning K.C. (now Lord Dening M.R.) drew the Court of Appeal's attention to host of authorities and as the headnote at p. 293 shows, the court held that:  ""A local authority carrying on a public hospital owes to a patient the duty to nurse and treat him properly, and is liable for the negligence of its servants even though the negligence arises while a servant is engaged on work which involves the exercise of professional skill on his part. Where, therefore, a patient being treated in such a hospital was injured by the negligence of a competent radiographer, who was a whole-time employee of the hospital, the local authority was liable for his negligence.""  In discussing the duty of such defendant hospitals, Goddard L.J. (as he then was) remarked in this case at p. 309 as follows:  ""Their duty would seem to be to maintain and treat the sick in their hospital, and that appears to me to oblige the defendants, not merely to provide a nurse and treatment, but to provide nursing, which they do and can only do by their servants. If there is negligent nursing I can see no ground on which they can say that they have discharged the duty cast on them.""  And in discussing the liability of such hospitals he continued at pp. 312-313 as follows:  ""I cannot understand on what principle a hospital authority is to be exempt from liability if a nurse carelessly administers a dose of poison to a patient instead of medicine, and yet is liable if the cook mixes some deleterious substance in the patient's food. Hospital managers, be they local authorities or governors of voluntary institutions, nowadays have in their service many specialists-solicitors, accountants, engineers, electricians and the like. I can see no sound reason why they should be responsible for the acts of these servants and not for those of nurses who are equally in their service.""  The position in which the plaintiff finds herself in this case is not new to the law in other jurisdictions which have had a common law foundation \[p.340\] and had been influenced by the reasoning of Pollock C.B. in Byrne v. Boadle (1863) 2 H. & C. 722 and Earle C.J. in Scott v. London and St. Katharine Docks Co. (1865) 3 H. & C. 596.  In the Supreme Court of California in 1944, Gibson C.J. dealt with a similar case. In Ybarra v. Spangard 25 Cal. 2d 486 (1944), the plaintiff was referred to a hospital after the physician had diagnosed appendicitis and arrangements were made as they were in this case for an operation. The surgeon performed appendectomy and in the process the plaintiff was given a hypodermic injection and was put under anaesthesia. Prior to the operation he had never had any pain in or injury to his right arm or shoulder but later he found, he could not rotate or lift his arm, and he developed paralysis and atrophy of the muscles around the shoulder. In rejecting the position taken by the defendants that assuming that the plaintiff's condition was in fact the result of an injury, there is no showing that the act of any particular defendant nor any particular instrumentality was the cause thereof, Gibson C.J. applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to found liability. He said (as quoted in Prosser and Smith Cases and Materials on Torts (3rd ed.), pp. 277-278) that:  ""The present case is of a type which comes within the reason and spirit of the doctrine more fully perhaps than any other. The passenger sitting awake in a railroad car at the time of a collision, the pedestrian walking along the street and struck by a falling object or the debris of an explosion, are surely not more entitled to an explanation than the unconscious patient on the operating table. Viewed from this aspect, it is difficult to see how the doctrine can, with any justification, be so restricted in its statement as to become inapplicable to a patient who submits himself to the care and custody of doctors and nurses, is rendered unconscious, and receives some injury from instrumentalities used in his treatment. Without the aid of the doctrine a patient who received permanent injuries of a serious character, obviously the result of someone's negligence, would be entirely unable to recover unless the doctors and nurses in attendance voluntarily chose to disclose the identity of the negligent person and the facts establishing liability ... If this were the state of the law of negligence, the courts, to avoid gross injustice, would be forced to invoke the principles of absolute liability, irrespective of negligence, in actions by persons suffering injuries during the course of treatment under anaesthesia. But we think this juncture has not yet been reached, and that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is properly applicable to the case before us.""  There is one further matter of extreme importance in this case. It is that no evidence of any sort was led by the defendant as to whether the needle used and the apparatus were sterilized. Evidence was not led that the dextrose drip and the blood given were not contaminated. Moreover the plaintiff led evidence to prove that the servant and accredited representative of the Republic, who was the senior medical officer in charge, Dr. Armar (who should know what he was talking about) admitted that \[p.341\] the hospital had made a mistake and yet no evidence was led to contradict this damaging piece of evidence, although there was no evidence that the named officer was not available.  In the result, it seems to me and I find as a fact that the defendant has not discharged the onus indicated in Nelson v. Klutse (supra) of showing that the injury which the plaintiff suffered in the hands of his servants happened through no fault of the said servants. In fact when the medical evidence was led the plaintiff sought leave to amend the statement of claim by adding paragraph 8 (c) as follows, ""The defendant failed to use clean or proper apparatus for the blood transfusion.""  I do not think this amendment is of any use to the plaintiff for no evidence whatsoever was led either by the plaintiff or the defendant to show that the apparatus was not clean or that it was not proper. The defendant also, without admitting liability, on hearing the medical evidence, sought an adjournment to endeavour to effect a settlement. The attempt at settlement failed and as counsel for both parties indicated to this court the failure was not because of the issue of negligence vel non, it was because the parties were not able to agree on the quantum of damages. As I have already indicated, on the material before me and guided by the principle in our leading case of Nelson v. Klutse (supra), I entertain no doubt whatsoever that the burden of proof which shifted to the defendant at the close of the plaintiff's case has not been discharged. I find therefore that the defendant who had a duty of care towards the plaintiff was, by his servants, negligent in the discharge of that duty and as a result the plaintiff developed gas gangrene and suffered the loss of her arm. I find the defendant liable in damages for the loss caused on the principle of respondeat superior.  This conclusion is amply supported by the case of Cassidy v. Ministry of Health \[1951\] 1 All E.R. 574, C.A. In that case a man in the position of the plaintiff, who was referred to a hospital to be cured of two stiff fingers, came out with four stiff fingers after the operation. Denning L.J. (as he then was) observed at p. 588 as follows:  ""The hospital authorities accepted the plaintiff as a patient for treatment and it was their duty to treat him with reasonable care. They selected, employed, and paid all the surgeons and nurses who looked after him. He had no say in their selection at all. If those surgeons and nurses did not treat him with proper care and skill, then the hospital authorities must answer for it, for it means that they themselves did not perform their duty to him.""  Holding that the case like the present case raised an issue of res ipsa loquitur and that the hospital authorities had not discharged the onus on them he held at the same page that, ""They have not, therefore displaced the prima facie case against them and are liable in damages to the plaintiff.""  I now come to a rather difficult problem. It is the question of damages. Apart from the comparatively easy matter of the special damages comprising the expenses reasonably incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the injury from the date of the injury to the date of trial, I have also to consider \[p.342\] in essence two related factors: The first is her incapacity to earn in the future what she once earned in her profession and the second is the actual physical loss of her right arm, what is often referred to in the books as personal loss, with its attendant pain and suffering and perhaps expenses and consequent and inevitable loss of some of the amenities of life. These factors have long been recognised in the assessment of damages in personal injury claims, and were stated long ago by Cockburn C.J. in one of the early English cases Fair v. London and North Western Railway Co. (1869) 21 L.T. 326 at p. 329 as follows:  ""in assessing ... compensation the jury should take into account two things; first the pecuniary loss he sustains by the accident; secondly, the injury he sustains in his person, or his physical capacity of enjoying life. When they come to the consideration of the pecuniary loss, they have to take into account not only his present loss, but his incapacity to earn a future improved income.""  And I should add his liability to incur future expenses. Ten years later in Phillips v. South Western Railway Co. (1879) 4 Q.B.D. 406 at pp. 407-408 he elaborated on these factors. In British Transport Commission v. Gourley \[1955\] 3 All E.R. 796 at p. 804, H.L. Lord Goddard C.J. stated the modern practice in assessing damages thus:  ""In an action for personal injuries, the damages are always divided into two main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage which has to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out of pocket expenses and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general damage which the law implies and which is not specially pleaded. This includes compensations for pain and suffering and the like and, if the injuries suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability, compensation for loss of earning power in the future. The basic principle, as far as loss of earnings and out of pocket expenses are concerned, is that the injured person should be placed in the same financial position so far as can be done by an award of money as he would have been had the accident not happened ...""  In the Fibre-Bag case (supra) cited with approval in Dagomba v. Dagomba, Court of Appeal, 27 January 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C.48, Azu Crabbe J.A. (as he then was) subjected many of the English authorities to close scrutiny and accepted the classification of the various heads of damage eligible for compensation contained in the dissenting opinion of Lord Devlin in H. West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard \[1963\] 2 All E.R. 625 at p. 636, H.L. There Lord Pearce read the opinion of Lord Devlin, drawing attention to the following heads:  (1) ""... compensation for medical expenses incurred and for loss of earnings during recovery; these are easily quantified, whether as special or general damage . . .""  \[p.343\]  (2) "". compensation for pain and suffering both physical and mental. This is at large ..""  (3) ""\[compensation for\] a temporary or permanent loss of a limb, organ or faculty. Whether it is the limb itself that is lost or the use of it is immaterial. What is to be compensated for is the loss of use and the deprivation thereby occasioned. This deprivation may bring with it three consequences. First, it may result in loss of earnings and they can be calculated. Secondly, it may put the victim to expense in that he has to pay others for doing what he formerly did for himself; and that also can be calculated. Thirdly, it produces loss of enjoyment, loss of amenities as it is sometimes called, a diminution in the full pleasure of living. This is incalculable and at large.""  There is a fourth sub-head referred to in the books as ""loss of expectation of life."" That head is not applicable here.  I now propose to assess the damages under these heads. The plaintiff was nineteen years of age at the date of the amputation. She stayed in the hospital for three months and one day. Before the injury she was a housewife and a seamstress. She had two children aged two and a half years and seven months respectively at the date of the injury. She used to wash her own clothes and those of her children and cook for her family. She was a right-handed person and did her normal household chores. Since the amputation she has been unable to sew or perform her household duties or attend her children. Her husband engaged a maidservant for her as she cannot now perform most of her household duties and she had been paying the maid �3.00 a month since her discharge from the hospital. She is now unable to pursue her calling as a seamstress because she is unable successfully to use only one hand for the purpose. Before the amputation she earned between �30.00 and �40.00 a month. In the course of the trial her customary law husband divorced her because he found it repulsive to sleep with a wife having only one arm.  In her pleadings, she only claimed loss of earnings at the rate of �30.00 a month for eleven months, i.e. �330.00. She did not claim the �3.00 a month which she has been paying, after the injury, to the maidservant and which she started paying since her discharge from hospital nor did she claim the �30.00 a month up to the date of trial. As Lord Goddard, already quoted, said in the Gourley case (supra) special damage has to be specially pleaded and proved. In lkiw v. Samuels \[1963\] 2 All E.R. 879, C.A. the plaintiff suffered injury in 1958 but his case came for trial in 1963. He claimed four months wages as special damage in his statement of claim and this was agreed to by the parties as �77. Evidence, however, was led of loss of earnings before trial at �200 per annum. In awarding general damages, Phillimore J., the trial judge, took account of the yearly loss of earnings between the accident and the trial. The Court of Appeal held that he should not have done that and the award was reduced. Diplock L. J. at the Court of Appeal stated the legal position at p. 890 as follows:  \[p.344\]  ""As regards the question of damages, I would put it in this way. Special damage in the sense of monetary loss which the plaintiff has sustained up to the date of trial must be pleaded and particularised. In this case special damages were so pleaded and particularised in the sum of �77 odd ... In my view, it is plain law-so plain that there appears to be no direct authority, because everyone has accepted it as being the law for the last hundred years--that one can recover in an action only special damage which has been pleaded, and, of course, proved. In the present case, evidence was called at the trial the effect of which was that the plaintiff had sustained special damage of a very much larger sum ... This was not pleaded ... The evidence about the loss of earnings in excess of �77 was admissible, not as proof of special damage ... but as a guide to what the future loss of earnings of the plaintiff might be.""  In the result, for special damage, I must, because of the principle of this case, ignore the amount in excess of the eleven months claim and the expenditure on the maidservant; and I will therefore award as special damage under Lord Devlin's head (1) in the Shephard case (supra), the �330.00 which was pleaded and proved. I must say though that I find the rule odious to apply and like Phillimore J. in Ilkiw v. Samuels (supra), I would have taken account of the full claim and ignored the fact that the claim for special damage was not pleaded. In my view where evidence has been led as in this case to demonstrate beyond peradventure that a plaintiff has legitimately incurred reasonable and necessary expenditure, any judge-made rule not founded on statute that deprives him of this amount which he is otherwise entitled to must be viewed with dismay. Of course I quite appreciate the plausible reason for the rule. The defendant must have an opportunity of knowing the precise figure which it is claimed had been lost so that he can prepare to meet it. This certainly can be done by granting him in adjournment. If this is the apparent reason for the rule then it has little to commend it since the plaintiff can by amending his pleadings render himself entitled to the claim. Another reason probably is that pleading the actual loss will aid speedy trial. This second reason is equally not impressive for in my view any system of jurisprudence which gives priority to expedition at the expense of justice is not useful to the society it is meant to serve.  Pleadings are generally meant to be servants not masters of the judicial process. Such bewilderingly technical notions of law inherent in such clearly judge-made rules cannot but bring the law into disrepute. They elevate form to the status of substance reminiscent of Maitland's forms of action. They visit the sins of the practitioners on the poor plaintiff and in a country like ours with a predominantly illiterate population ignorant of the legal process, the populace cannot have respect for a legal system that insists that expenditure legitimately and properly incurred should not be paid because of an apparent omission in the pleadings caused by a lawyer's incompetence or inadvertence.  \[p.345\]  The rule being undoubtedly English in origin and consequently merely of persuasive authority would not have bound me and because I am not impressed by the apparent reasons behind it I would have rejected it; unfortunately in Jima Lagos v. A. Lang Ltd., Court of Appeal, 27 July 1973, unreported, our Court of Appeal accepted the principle of the decision of Ilkiw v. Samuels (supra) without any question or comment. In that case, the plaintiff obtained judgment in the High Court, Kumasi, against the defendant. He was awarded �5,000.00 damages for injuries he sustained in an accident as a result of the negligence of the defendant. The sum was apportioned as follows:  (1) �1,000.00 total loss of earnings between the time of the accident and the coming into force of the Ghanaian Business Promotion Act, 1970 (Act 334), when the plaintiff being an alien was expected to stop work;  (2) �1,000.00 for pain and suffering; and  (3) �3,000.00 for loss of amenities.  The plaintiff did not plead the �1,000.00 loss of earnings as special damage and Sowah J.A. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal said after quoting Ilkiw v. Samuels (supra) that, ""The plaintiff had not claimed nor pleaded special damage there was therefore no basis for the award of �1,000.00 . . . "" The �1,000.00 awarded by the trial judge was therefore disallowed. Since this decision of our Court of Appeal in Jima Lagos v. A. Lang Ltd. binds me, I have with regret applied the rule. I have done so with reluctance because my sense of justice is scandalised and furthermore but for the decision of the Court of Appeal, I would have thought there was no legal foundation for the rule in Ghana.  The reason is simple. Until 21 August 1954, when the present High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, were introduced into Ghana, the trial of cases did not as a rule involve pleadings. They were then regulated by the rules contained in the Second Schedule to the Courts Ordinance., Cap. 4 (1951 Rev.), being the rules which apply even now to proceedings in the district courts. As Diplock L.J. pointed out in Ilkiw v, Samuels (supra) ""there appears to be no direct authority"" for the English rule ""because everyone has accepted it as being the law for the last hundred years. ""Since it is not a creature of statute it must be the child of the common law. Clearly during the time the rule was being applied in England before 21 August 1954, it could not have been extended to Ghana under any rule of law because we just did not as a general rule operate on pleadings. Although as from 24 July 1874, the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application, which were in force in England came into force in this country by virtue of section 83 of the Courts Ordinance, Cap. 4 (1951 Rev.), now repealed, it is clear to me that this rule could not possibly be part of the common law made applicable because as from 24 July 1874 to 21 August 1954 it was not feasible to apply it and in view of that one could safely say that it was not part of our law. If it became law in Ghana then it must have come into existence \[p.346\] at a date after 21 August 1954. I have searched hard, but I have not discovered its birthday. However in view of the doctrine of judicial precedent I have applied it and I will accordingly limit the special damage as I have already said to the amount pleaded and proved, namely, �330.00.  I now come to Lord Devlin's head (2), i.e. ""pain and suffering both physical and mental."" These and two of the sub-heads of Lord Devlin's head (3) are what have been called the non-pecuniary loss. They are at large and in my view are probably the root cause of the difficulties which countless of generations of common law judges have expressed culminating in this typical expression in the judgment of Azu Crabbe J.A. (as he then was) in the Fibre-Bag case (supra):  ""The task of awarding monetary compensation for personal injuries is a difficult one, and it is essentially a matter of opinion. But I think it is desirable that some endeavour should be made to secure uniformity in assessment of damages when considering claims in actions for personal injuries.""  In 1951 Birkett L.J. formulated for the first time a guiding principle, (having regard to comparable cases in assessment of damages) which had for many years been feeling its way into the law. In Bird v. Cocking & Sons., Ltd. \[1951\] 2 T.L.R. 1260, C.A. he said:  ""Although there is no fixed and unalterable standard, the courts have been making these assessments for many years, and I think that they do form some guide to the kind of figure which is appropriate. . . when, therefore, a particular matter comes for review, one of the questions is, how does this accord with the general run of assessments made over the years in comparable cases.""  Two years later he reiterated it in Rushton v. National Coal Board \[1953\] 1 All E.R. 314 at p. 317, C.A. and in Waldon v. War Office \[1956\] 1 All E.R. 108, C.A., Singleton L.J. expressed similar views. The principle was accepted in 1964 by the House of Lords in H. West & Son, Ltd. v. Shephard (supra) and the view of the House of Lords on the matter was also accepted by our Court of Appeal in 1967 in the Fibre-Bag case (supra). In that case Azu Crabbe J.A. (as he then was) said:  ""It is also desirable that \`so far as possible comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards': per Lord Morris in H. West & Son, Ltd. v. Shephard \[1963\] 2 All E.R. 625 at p. 631, H.L.""  Proceeding under the above advice of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the Shephard case (supra), sponsored by Azu Crabbe J.A. as he then was, I have looked at a number of awards in Kemp and Kemp. The Quantum of Damages (2nd ed.), Vol. 1 at pp. 445-467, Munkman, Damages for Personal Injuries and Death (5th ed.) at pp. 237-246 and 1971-74, Current Law but I have been particularly assisted by the chapter on recent awards appearing now in the Review of Ghana Law from 1972 onwards. In looking \[p.347\] at these awards, I am not unmindful of the fact that inflation had played havoc with the Ghana economy and that the cedi in say 1967 is certainly worth more in terms of its purchasing power than the cedi in 1975. Moreover the English cases based as they must be on England's economic conditions and norms must necessarily be less useful than the Ghanaian cases, for, as Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest reading the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council observed in Singh v. Toong Fong Omnibus Co., Ltd. \[1964\] 3 All E.R. 925 at p. 927:  ""to the extent to which regard should be had to the range of awards in other cases which are comparable, such cases should as a rule be those which have been determined in the same jurisdiction or in a neighbouring locality where similar social, economic and industrial conditions exist.""  In glancing through case after case, I think without being emotional, I must nevertheless remember the poignant query posed by Lord Dunedin in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Valeria \[1922\] 2 A.C. 242 at p. 248, H.L., ""If by somebody's fault I lose my leg and am paid damages, can anyone in his senses say I have had restitutio in integrum?"" Nevertheless, I apprehend I must make the attempt to restore the status quo as far as that can be done by payment of money. Furthermore I do realise that the mechanical perusal of a host of authorities can be dangerous. As Sachs L.J. rightly warned in Jones v. Griffith \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 1015 at p. 1017, C.A.:  ""As to the decisions cited one must be careful not to do more than look on them as showing a trend of figures of damage and as examples of figures within the correct brackets on the particular facts of the individual cases. One must remember too that of those facts sometimes only a proportion can be found even in a full report, and certainly that is often the position in abbreviated report.""  I regret that many of the cases I perused gave merely global figures not divided into the conventional heads to enable me to identify the trends they are meant to illustrate. Whatever merit there may be in this approach, in my view, it is to be deprecated. In this connection I do not propose to lose sight of the observations of Goddard L.J. in The Testbank \[1942\] P. 75, C.A. where he said at p. 80 that, ""It is, no doubt, true that one cannot apportion blame with anything approaching mathematical accuracy."" But surely lumping personal and pecuniary losses together is certainly slovenly, for it cannot be a neat method of dealing with two sets of quantities one of which is amenable to some form of mathematical calculation while the other is not. The method has the tendency of disguising the arithmetical foundation of the computable quantity and it enables a mistake to be absorbed by the quantity that is at large.  I am aware that this practice is followed by some judges in England, but a practice ought not to be acceptable to an independent bench like \[p.348\] ours merely because English judges follow it particularly if they provide no sound reasons for indulging in it and where on the contrary there are good reasons for rejecting it.  The plaintiff in this case was nineteen years old at the time of the injury. She was then married under customary law. She had her right arm amputated a few inches above the elbow and she was hospitalized for three months and one day. Before the amputation she had developed gas gangrene. It is not certain the precise time when gas gangrene set in, the observation of the husband shows that for about three or four days she was in extreme pain. Her hand had gone black including her palm and was swollen and exuding a bad odour and she was groaning.  In Dzamafe v. Tema Textiles Co., Ltd., High Court, Kumasi, 4 June 1971, unreported; digested in (1972) 4 R.G.L. 63, a male factory cleaner aged 24 had his right index and middle finger crushed at work leaving only a stump of the index finger and phalanx of the middle finger. He was hospitalized for two months. Mensa Boison J. awarded him �9,000.00 general damages (made up of �2,000.00 for pain and suffering; �6,000.00 for loss of earnings and �1,000.00 for loss of amenities.) In Okyere v. Twum, High Court, Cape Coast, 26 June 1972, unreported digested in (1972) 4 R.G.L. 213, a male canoe builder aged 24 whose right hand was rendered useless was awarded damages by Edward Wiredu J. as follows: general damages of �10,845.00 (made up of �945 pre trial loss of earnings, �1,500.00 for pain and suffering; �900.00 for loss of amenities, �1,000.00 for handicap in the labour market; �6,500.00 for physical disability.) In Wiafe v. Hornyibey, High Court, Kumasi, 27 June 1972, unreported; digested in (1972) 4 R.G.L. 212, a married female trader aged 37, earning �480.00 per annum, a ballroom dance enthusiast and a keen sportswoman had her right arm amputated. Koranteng-Addow J. awarded her damages as follows: general damages of �10,047.00 (made up of �6,000.00 loss of earnings at fifteen years' purchase scaled down, �3,000.00 for pain and suffering, loss of amenities and wages of servants to do domestic work.) In Amfo v. Twum, High Court, Cape Coast, 26 June 1972, unreported; digested in (1972) 4 R.G.L. 212, a farmer aged 30, earning �720.00 per annum had a right upper brachial plexus traction injury rendering the right upper arm useless. Edward Wiredu J. awarded her general damages of �9,140,00 made up of �2,750.00 for pain and suffering, �1,000.00 for loss of amenities, �840.00 for pre-trial loss of income, �4,550.00 for physical disability. In Gonja v. Anang, High Court, Accra, 18 May 1973, unreported; digested in (1973) 5 R.G.L. 121, a male yam farmer aged 49 years, had a double fracture of his right forearm; he developed arthritis of the wrist joint and pains in the elbow. His permanent disability however was twenty per cent and Sarkodee J. awarded him �4,000.00 general damages (made up of �1,000.00 for pain and suffering, �3,000.00 for loss of earnings and �400.00 for loss of amenities.).  All these cases are decisions of the High Court digested in the Review of Ghana Law. I have looked at them carefully in an effort to glean the trends. In the Fibre-Bag case already referred to herein the award of \[p.349\] �700.00 for pain and suffering by Annan J. (as he then was); was approved by the Court of Appeal. In that case the claimant, a male of 21 years of age, was unmarried with one child. On 10 May 1964, he had a severe compound fracture (crash injury) of the right hand amounting virtually to traumatic amputation of the right hand above the level of the wrist joint.  The injury necessitated surgical amputation of the right hand above the level of the wrist joint. There were lacerated wounds involving the index and the middle fingers of the left hand. The evidence further showed that the claimant's left finger had been permanently deformed, and that this would interfere with his capacity to grip objects or things.  Now an analysis of these cases shows that the amounts awarded for pain and suffering in cases of amputation of the right arm oscillate between roughly �1,000.00 and �3,000.00 depending no doubt, on the circumstance of the case and in particular, on the degree of pain suffered and likely to be suffered in the future. Having regard to the circumstances, the period of her hospitalization, the fact that for about 48 hours she was in agony and her evidence that after the amputation, she felt pains in the stump and having regard to the decline in the value of the cedi, I will award �1,500.00 for pain and suffering.  With regard to Lord Devlin's head 3 (i) in the Shephard case (supra), I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she earned a minimum of �30.00 and a maximum of �40.00 per month depending on market conditions. I will therefore strike a mean and take the sum of �35.00 as the average monthly income. This will be �420.00 per annum. I am not unmindful of the fact that the plaintiff had only just set up practice as a seamstress. Surely with experience and the passage of time, she ought to be able to improve on her earnings. At the date of trial she was 22 years old. With modern medical facilities and the systematic improvements in living conditions in this country and considering the hardiness of our women folk, I think she is entitled to look forward to at least 35 years of working life, if not more. I know that, this is subject to various contingencies some advantageous others not, but making all allowances as best I can for all probable and possible contingencies I will choose eighteen years' purchase and award under head 3 (i), �7,560.00. This is quite consistent with the approach of Annan J. (as he then was) in Amponsah v. Boakye, High Court Kumasi, 10 June 1970, unreported. In that case very much like the present case, the plaintiff whose right arm was amputated just below the shoulder was 35 years old and earning �60.00 a month as a seamstress. Annan J. would seem to have given her �7,200.00 for loss of earnings on the terms of ten years' purchase.  With regard to Lord Devlin's head 3 (ii), I think the plaintiff is entitled to the services of a maidservant as it is quite clear that she cannot wash her clothes, cook without assistance, effectively look after her children and carry out her normal household and other duties without help. This is a proper head of claim as is exemplified in Cunningham v. Harrison \[1973\] 3 W.L.R. 97, C.A. At the present time she pays the maidservant \[p.350\] �3.00 a month and feeds and clothes her. Having regard to present day trends in costs I will put the salary of the maidservant plus the cost of food and clothing at �20.00 a month. This means she would spend on her �240.00 per annum. I will capitalize this at �3,000.00 because she is to receive it now instead of over the period of her life expectancy.  The loss in Lord Devlin's head 3 (iii), loss of amenities, is at large. In the Fibre-Bag case (supra) Annan J. (as he then was) awarded �4,800. 00 under this head but the Court of Appeal reduced it to �2,800.00. Most of the awards under this head oscillate between �1,000.00 and �3,000.00. Although in the Fibre-Bag case, which in my view is not as serious as this case, �2,800.00 was awarded, I do not think the award here should be more than this because in this case unlike most other local cases I have come across, the loss of enjoyment of the pleasures of life which is the basis for this claim, is also somehow to some extent partially ameliorated by the award under head 3 (ii) and I must therefore guard against duplication. I will therefore award only �2,500.00 to be within the bracket indicated by the trend in the cases.  There is also a head of claim which is peculiar to the plaintiff. Her husband has now divorced her in view of her deformity. There may be something to be said against a customary system of law that permits divorce on this ground and under such circumstance but that is not a matter germane to the problem I have in hand, suffice it to say that she has lost her marital status and I do not for myself see that her prospects of obtaining a husband are good. This in my view is a legitimate head of claim. In O'Connor v. Cartwright \[1974\] 5 C.L. 81, the female plaintiff was aged seventeen at the date of the accident and 24 at the date of hearing. She was injured in a car accident and she suffered severe brain and other injuries resulting, inter alia, in hormone deficiency and impairment of endocrine function and consequential infertility. She was engaged to be married to her childhood sweetheart before the accident. After the accident the engagement was broken off because of her injuries. Wien J. remarking that her marriage prospects were nil awarded her total general damages of �32,600 and included in this figure was the global sum of �15,000 for pain and loss of amenities including loss of marriage prospects.  In Ghana (and I am sure in almost all countries) marriage for a woman does not merely create a status, it brings in its train financial advantages. The husband is obliged to maintain the wife, to look after her in sickness and to be a comfort to her in times of difficulty. He may give her presents on occasions and in some cases make provision for her future. She has lost all these and I am to assess the loss in terms of cedis. It is an invidious task. This type of financial loss is subject to so many contingencies and vagaries of life that I will award her a nominal sum of �1,200.00 for the loss of her marital status and the diminution in her prospects of remarriage. This should meet the justice of her case, for although she has lost an arm she is still young, beautiful and charming.  In the result I give judgment for the plaintiff and I will award her �330.00 special damages and a total sum of �15,760.00 as general damages made up as follows:  \[p.351\]  (1) Pain and suffering .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,500.00  (2) Loss of future earnings .. .. .. .. .. 7,560.00  (3) Expenses for maintaining and employing a maidservant .. .. 3,000.00  (4) Loss of amenities of life .. .. .. .. .. 2,500.00  (5) Loss of her marital status and diminution in prospects of remarriage 1,200.00  She will have her costs assessed at .. .. .. .. �800.00.

"JUDGMENT OF SARKODEE J.  The plaintiff who is employed by the co-defendants, the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., as a machine driver was on 11 July 1974 injured whilst working underground at the said mines. He suffered a compressed fracture of the twelfth thoraxic vertebrae resulting in the paralysis of the lower limbs. The accident occurred when the plaintiff acting upon instructions was working as a shovel boy; a job which was not part of his normal duties. In the course of drilling and shovelling loose rocks a mass of loose graphite fell on him causing him those injuries as a result of which he has been in hospital since the date of the accident.  Originally the action was brought against the defendants only in their capacity as a gold mining corporation carrying on business at Prestea. After the evidence of the plaintiff upon application made on his behalf the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. were joined as co-defendants. In his amended statement of claim which followed the joinder the plaintiff stated that the co-defendants were agents and (or servants) of the defendants. The defendants denied that they were the employers of the plaintiff at the time of accident. The co-defendants on their part admitted that the defendants were a gold mining corporation but said that they the co-defendants were a subsidiary company of the defendants and that it was wrong for the plaintiff to sue the shareholders for the wrongs of a company. Mr. Kocuvie Tay, learned counsel for both the defendants and co-defendants, submitted that the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. were the owners of the mines and that the defendants as shareholders had been wrongly sued.  The State Gold Mining Corporation was established under the Statutory Corporations Act, 1964 (Act 232). By Part II of the Instrument of Incorporation of the State Gold Mining Corporation, 1965 (L.I. 400), the objects of the State Gold Mining Corporation are:  ""(a) the mining of gold and the marketing of gold in Ghana and outside Ghana;  (b) the carrying on of such other activities as may appear to the Corporation to be incidental or conducive to the attainment of the objects set out in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph or any .of them.""  The governing body of the State Gold Mining Corporation is a board which has power to delegate to the managing director of a mining company the power to appoint persons as employees of the corporation. This power to appoint is reserved for the owner of the mines. It is not denied that the state Gold Mining Corporation appoints the general manager, the chief engineer and the general mines Manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. as is required by the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665). The daily-rated employees and other junior staff of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. are appointed by the Prestea Goldfields but this does not detract from the fact that the Prestea Goldfields itself derives its authority to run the mines generally from the State Gold Mining Corporation. In order to control and effectively monitor the system of work at Prestea Goldfields Ltd. the State Gold Mining Corporation has introduced a method by which Prestea Goldfields Ltd. sends monthly returns for payment and \[p.208\] other activities to the State Gold Mining Corporation. In my view therefore the State Gold Mining Corporation effectively controls the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., who is the agent of the State Gold Mining Corporation.  The next question to consider is whether the State Gold Mining Corporation works the mines through their agent Prestea Goldfields Ltd. A company is said to be the subsidiary of another if that other (the holding company) is a member of it and controls the composition of its board of directors, or if the holding company holds more than half its ""equity share capital"": see the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), Sched. I, s. 2. Under the ordinary rules of law a parent company and a subsidiary company, even a hundred per cent subsidiary, are distinct legal entities. However it seems there is no rule of law which says that a company cannot and should not act as the agent of its holders. No problem arises where there is an express agreement as in Southern (Inspector of Taxes) v. Watson \[1940\] 3 All E.R. 439, C.A. where after the business had been converted into a private company the agreement provided that the company should fulfil existing contracts as agents of the seller. Where there is no such agreement it is a question of fact in each case whether the subsidiary company is carrying on the parent company's business or its own.  In this regard I think all the circumstances must be taken into account the following being particularly relevant:  (1) Are the profits treated as those of the parent company?  (2) Are the persons conducting the business appointed by the parent company?  (3) Is the parent company the head and brain of the enterprise?  (4) Does the parent company govern the business and decide what should be done and what capital should be employed?  (5) Are the profits made by its skill and direction ?  (6) Is the parent company in effectual control?  From the evidence of the plaintiff�s third witness, the personnel manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd., and that of the plaintiff�s fourth witness, the Chief Inspector of Mines, there is no doubt that all these questions ought to be answered in the affirmative. The State Gold Mining Corporation holds all the shares of the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. The profits of Prestea Goldfields are treated as profits of the State Gold Mining Corporation. It is the State Gold Mining Corporation which appoints the persons who conduct the business of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. and who are in effective and constant control. These persons are the general manager, the mines manager and the chief engineer of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. To enable it to stamp its control on the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., the State Gold Mining Corporation by its manager appoints other senior employees who conduct the day to day affairs of the subsidiary company, the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. Some of the members of the State Gold Mining Corporation constitute the board of directors of Prestea Goldfields Ltd., commonly called the local board. Besides, the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665), make the working of mine the responsibility of the manager who is also responsible for the safety and proper discipline of the men employed above \[p.209\] and below ground. It is clear therefore that Prestea Goldfields Ltd. carries on the business of the State Gold Mining Corporation.  A person causing something to be done the doing of which casts on him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching to him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to another. The maxim qui facit per alium facit per se applies. Where a person is authorised by statute or bound by contract to do a particular job he cannot escape responsibility by contracting with another person to do it. The position is different where the act complained of is purely collateral. In Pickard v. Smith (1861) 10 C.B. (N.S.) 470 at p. 473 counsel in arguing the case purported to quote a statement of Wilde B. in Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Consumers (1853) 2 El. & Bl. 767 as follows:  "" 'The distinction appears to me to be that, when work is being done under a contract, if an accident happens and an injury is caused by negligence in a matter entirely collateral to the contract, the liability turns on the question whether the relation of master servant exists. But, when the thing contracted to be done causes the mischief, and the injury can only be said to arise from the authority of the employer because the thing contracted to be done is imperfectly performed, there the employer must be taken to have authorized the act, and is responsible for it'.""  From exhibit A, (the accident inquiries report) submitted by the Inspector of Mines the plaintiff was seriously injured whilst he was resting near the footwall side of the stope drive after shovelling. The area did not appear to have been effectively barred down of loose or loosened rocks by the senior headman and it appears from the report that the provisions of the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665), were not strictly adhered to. The responsibility of the agent is that of the employer and the State Gold Mining Corporation must be held liable for the negligence of the mines manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. Whether or not the plaintiff was resting at the time of the accident makes no difference for at the time he was underground and could not have left the mines on his own accord. If indeed he had completed his work, he still had to wait until he and all the others were brought to the surface at the scheduled time. In all the circumstances I hold that the State Gold Mining Corporation are liable for the injury to the plaintiff.  What then will be a reasonable compensation for the injuries the plaintiff suffered. I will assess damages under the following heads: pecuniary loss, loss of future income, loss of amenities and pain and suffering.  At the time of the accident the plaintiff was receiving �2.88 a day. This is �86.40 a month. After the accident he was paid only part of his wages and at the time he gave evidence he was being paid �50.00 a month, the highest he had received since the accident; at times it was less. This means he lost at least �36.40 every month, which amount, but for the accident should have gone to him. For the three-and-a-half years he lost a total of �1,528.80 in wages. To this must be added the sums he earned from laying traps and farming which I reckon to be not less than �10.00 \[p.210\] a week. This gives a total of �480 per year. This from the date of the accident to the date of judgment comes to �1,680. This added to the loss of wages brings the total loss of income to �3,208.80. This must be taxed and I will therefore award him �3,000 under this head.  This brings me to loss of future income caused by the accident. The plaintiff said he was 35 years old in March 1977 but his service record, exhibit 1 shows that at the time he was first engaged, in 1962 he was 25 years old. I think I can safely rely on the service record and find that the plaintiff was 37 years old at the time of the accident. He would have retired at the age of 55 and therefore if he had not been injured he would have actively served a total of eighteen years. His total income based on his wages at the time of the accident would be about �11,600 but it must be remembered that his wages were likely to be increased during the period and indeed the minimum wage is now �4 a day. I think it would not be unreasonable to say he would have earned a total of �15,000.00. I must also consider his earnings from traps and farming which he could have pursued after his retirement. He was 37 years old at the time of the accident. Granting good health and barring other mishaps he could have done those two jobs for at least 24 years. He is totally incapacitated. I will therefore take 24 years' purchase and assess compensation to the plaintiff in the sum of �2,880.00. Under this head, therefore, I will award in the aggregate the sum of �17,880. Having regard to contingencies of life I will reduce this amount to �17,500 for loss of future earnings.  In considering what figure to award for loss of amenities a number of factors ought to be taken into account. The plaintiff�s second witness the medical officer at Prestea Goldfields Ltd. said when he examined the plaintiff after the accident he was found to have had a fracture of the thoraxic vertebrae or back bone. As a result he was paralysed from the waist downwards and could do nothing for himself; he had no control over his urine and bowels. The doctor went on the plaintiff may not be able to walk again. In his present condition he can feed himself but urinals and bed pans will have to be supplied to him and possibly he will have to be given a bed bath. He has been in hospital since the date of the accident on 11 July 1974. He has since been lying on his back and cannot leave his bed without assistance. The plaintiff�s hip-joint bones are prominent and showing due to the wasting of the spinal cord. The doctor assessed his permanent incapacity as 100 per cent. The doctor was not cross-examined on any of these details and therefore his evidence was not challenged.  The plaintiff had two wives both of whom left him after the accident and have since not returned to him. He has four children all alive, the eldest of whom is aged about eleven years and the youngest three years at the time of the accident. There is no evidence as to how the plaintiff spent his pastime. Nothing was said about his pleasures the enjoyment of which has been cut short by the accident. Perhaps the only loss of importance is impairment of sexual activity since the accident. For a man who at the age of 37 had married two wives and had four children this should be a serious diminution of the enjoyment of life considering \[p.211\] the extent and the results within this short span. He must be compensated for that. As far as money can do it I think �1,000 will be reasonable.  The plaintiff 's wives have left him. He may be able to move in a wheelchair but he must be lifted from his bed. He cannot do anything for himself and perhaps worst of all he suffers from lack of control of his urine and bowels. What would he do if he were discharged from hospital? No woman would want to stay with him let alone marry him. His children are young and cannot look after him. Even if they could they have to go to school and could not be with him all the time. Perhaps he will have to engage a nurse and pay him. He may be lucky to count on the help of close relations but if they are to be of any use to him they must give him constant attention and as far as practicable be with him always. Therefore whoever offers his services must be fittingly and adequately rewarded in terms of money. Again taking 24 years purchase I will award the plaintiff �7,600. The plaintiff might not live that long and so I will scale this figure down and award him �7,000. All told I award him �8,000 for loss of amenities.  This leaves me only with damages under the head, pain and suffering. There is no doubt the plaintiff was seriously injured. Whilst he bent down shovelling, the ceiling fell and hit his back and waist. The ceiling had no support and must have fallen heavily on the plaintiff. He could not get up again and had to be carried to the surface straight to hospital where he has been ever since. He was referred to a specialist at Sekondi where he remained for eleven months after which because of his deteriorating condition the Sekondi hospital advised he should be taken to Prestea hospital. He is 100 per cent incapacitated. He has bed sores as a result of lying in bed all the time. In all the plaintiff must have suffered considerable and continuous pain. I think the sum of �2,000 will be reasonable.  I would accordingly award damages in favour of the plaintiff as follows:  Pecuniary loss .. .. .. .. .. 3,000.00  Loss of future, earnings .. .. .. .. 17,500.00  Loss of amenities .. .. .. .. .. 8,000.00  Pain and suffering .. .. .. .. .. 2,000.00  Total .. .. .. 30,500.00  DECISION  Judgment for the plaintiff.

"On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.  Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  A PETITION for the official winding-up of a limited liability company wherein the respondents raised a preliminary objection. The facts are fully stated in the ruling.  COUNSEL  Joe Reindorf for the petitioners.  E. D. Kom (Jonathan Arthur with him) for the respondents.  George Thompson for the Registrar of Companies.  JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI J.  This is a petition for the official winding-up of a limited liability company called Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. The original name of the company which was formed \[p.372\] in 1966, was Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. On 20 July 1971, Timber & Transport Co., Ltd., its principal shareholders, Osei Bonsu Snr. and Osei Bonsu Jnr., entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company, Sumsko-Industrijski Kombinat �Crvena Zastava� or the �Red Flag� Timber Industrial Combine, whereby the Osei Bonsus agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav company which, for its part, agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of the company would be changed to its present form, the town of Krusevac being the situation of the registered office and the principal place of business of the Yugoslav company.  The affidavit attached to the petition shows that the Yugoslav company took up its shares, invested U.S. $250,000 as equity share capital, appointed a new managing director and brought over from Yugoslavia a number of experts to assist in running the joint enterprise. The name of the company was on 1 September 1971 changed to its present form. From that moment, it could be said that the fundamental obligations assumed by the parties under the agreement had been performed, and that to that extent the contract was discharged by performance. In so far as anything more remained to be done, clause 16 provided that the agreement should take precedence over and prevail against the regulations of Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. wherever the two were in conflict, and it was further directed that a resolution to that effect be passed by the board of directors of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. and registered along with a copy of the agreement with the Registrar of Companies.  Differences having arisen between the parties to the agreement, the Osei Bonsus have caused a writ to be issued in this court against the �Red Flag� Timber & Industrial Combine claiming the following reliefs:  �(a) Rescission of the contract dated 20 July 1971;  (b) Declaration that the said contract is discharged; or  (c) Damages for breach of the said contract.�  The writ and statement of claim are attached to this petition as exhibits 00.10 and 00.11. The answer of the Yugoslav company is this petition for the official winding-up of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. On 12 February 1979, this court heard and granted an ex parte application filed on behalf of the Yugoslav company for the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as provisional liquidator under section 4 (7) of the Bodies Corporate \[p.373\] (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180), and for an appropriate injunction.  On the hearing of the petition itself, Mr. Kom, counsel for the respondents, has raised as a preliminary point, the question whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition is competent. Clause 15 provides:  �Upon coming into force and effect as aforesaid, this agreement shall be and remain irrevocable for ten years, and accordingly no member or director of the new company may, during the term of ten years immediately following upon coming into force of this agreement, present a resolution to the board of directors or an application to court, seeking the liquidation or winding-up whether voluntary or involuntary of the new com- pany or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the new company to an end. After the expiration of the said ten years this agreement shall continue in force from year to year, and any member or director of the new company who then desires to bring the existence of the new company to an end shall give in writing not less than one year's notice to the board of directors of any step he intends to take for achieving that desire.� There is no room for argument that by clause 15 the parties to the agreement bound themselves not to seek either in court or elsewhere the winding-up of the company as re-constituted until after the expiration of a period of at least ten years.  Mr. Reindorf, counsel for the petitioners, however, contends that clause 15 is void because it contravenes the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) and the Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180). Of the various cases cited by him only In re Peveril Gold Mines, Ltd. \[1898\] 1 Ch. 122, C.A. need be considered in some detail. In that case, a motion was brought on behalf of two of the shareholders of the company to stay proceedings upon a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company. The petition had been presented by a shareholder holding 5,000 fully-paid shares. One of the two shareholders held 20 shares, on which 16s. 6d. per share had been paid, and the other held 13,600 fully-paid shares. All the shares were of the nominal value of �1 each. It was conceded for the purposes of the motion that the petitioner was a contributory who would be entitled to petition, but for clause 164 of the articles of association, which provided:  �No petition shall be presented or proceeded with by a member to wind up the company, except and unless (a) by consent in \[p.374\] writing of not less than two of the then board, or (b) in pursuance or by permission of a resolution passed by a majority at a general meeting of the company, or (c) the petitioner or petitioners shall hold, or together hold, not less than one-fifth of the then issued capital of the company, upon which all calls shall have been paid.�  It was admitted that the petitioner had not complied with any one of the conditions mentioned in the clause.  The motion came before Byrne J. He was of the view that although section 82 of the Companies Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 89), laid it down that a contributory �may� present a petition, it conferred a right upon every shareholder just as much as if the terms of the section had been that every contributory should have �the right to present a petition.� He held that the terms of the section were intended to confer a right of which a contributory could not be deprived, either entirely or in a modified way, by the terms of the articles of association. At p. 123 he said:  �The memorandum and the articles of association embody the contract between the different members of the company, but those documents must not conflict with the provisions of the Acts regulating the incorporation of joint stock companies.�  And he continued at pp. 124-126:  �. . . the question really is, whether or not the petitioner has by becoming a shareholder entered into a contract, enforceable either by the company or by other individual shareholders, not to exercise the right which s. 82 prima facie in terms confers upon him . . . The article which I have to deal with is really an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share, in contravention of the provisions of the Act of Parliament . . . If the articles are to be regarded as part of the terms of the contract between the company and the person applying for shares, I am of opinion that the company had no right, having regard to the Act of Parliament, to enter into such contract as a condition and part of the general contract binding upon all shareholders, whatever separate or distinct bargain they might have the power to make with an individual who happened to be or to desire to become a shareholder.�  On appeal to the Court of Appeal the decision by Byrne J. was affirmed. At. p. 131 Lindley M. R. said:  �Any one who is familiar with the Companies Acts knows perfectly well that these registered limited companies are \[p.375\] incorporated on certain conditions; they continue to exist on certain conditions; and they are liable to be dissolved on certain conditions. The important sections of the Act of 1862, with regard to dissolution, are ss. 79 and 82. Sect. 79 states the circumstances under which such a company may be dissolved by the Court, and s. 82 states the persons who may petition for a dissolution. Any article contrary to these sections�any article which says that the company is formed on the condition that its life shall not be terminated when any of the circumstances mentioned in s. 79 exist, or which limits the right of a contributory under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, would be an attempt to enforce on all the shareholders that which is at variance with the statutory conditions, and is invalid.�  At p. 132 Chitty L.J. said:  �In my opinion, this condition is annexed to the incorporation of a company with limited liability�that the company may be wound up under the circumstances, and at the instance of the persons, prescribed by the Act, and the articles of association cannot validly provide that the shareholders, who are entitled under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, shall not do so except on certain conditions.�  However, like Byrne J., the Court of Appeal left open the question whether the company, or for that matter the shareholders among themselves, could enter into an agreement outside the regulations waiving or limiting a shareholder's statutory right to petition for the official winding-up of the company. At p. 131 Lindley M. R. said: �I do not intend to decide whether a valid contract may or may not be made between the company and an individual shareholder that he shall not petition for the winding-up of the company. That point does not arise now.� And Chitty L.J. also said at pp. 131-132: �We have not now to consider whether an individual shareholder can or cannot bind himself not to petition for the winding-up of the company.�  In the earlier case of Welton v. Saffery \[1897\] A.C. 299 the House of Lords had agreed that what may not be made a regulation of the company binding upon all present and future members of the company may be made the subject of a private bargain between individual members among themselves. In the words of Lord Davey at p. 331:  �Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such way as they may think fit. But such \[p.376\] contracts, whether made by all or some only of the shareholders, would create personal obligations, or an exceptio personalis against themselves only, and would not become a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties to it, or upon new or non-assenting shareholders.�  The respondents have been at pains to point out that the agreement of 20 July 1971 was prepared by counsel for the petitioners. I can well imagine the petitioners as investors wanting some assurance that the agreement would be given a reasonable span of life to enable them make a success of the joint venture. Now, however, they say that clause 15 contravenes section 4 (1) of Act 180, and is therefore void. Section 4 (1) provides:  �4. (1) The Registrar or any person who is,  (a) a creditor of the company,  (b) a member or contributory of the company, or  (c) the Attorney-General, but only on the ground specified in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, may present a petition to the Court for the official winding-up of the company.� If, following In re Peveril (supra), we read �may present a petition to the Court� to mean �have a right to present a petition to the Court,� the question still remains whether it was open to the parties to the agreement to say, in effect, that that agreement was to remain irrevocable for a period of ten years. In my opinion it was. The agreement bound only the parties to it. Even if a copy was lodged with the Registrar of Companies it did not become part of the regulations of the company binding upon any existing or subsequent shareholder who did not give his individual assent to it. Unlike the clause in question in In re Peveril (supra) clause 15 was not, to quote Byrne J. again at p. 125, �an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share� in contravention of the provisions of Act 180, but part of a private agreement outside the machinery of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179).  The law is clear that every contract is prima facie permanent and irrevocable and it lies upon a person who says that it is revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself, or something in the nature of the contract, from which it is reasonably to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination: see Llanelly Railway & Dock Co. v. London & North-Western Railway Co. (1873) 8 Ch.App. 942 at pp. 949-950 per \[p.377\] James L.J. The effect of clause 15, then, is that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement can apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. Here, if I may borrow the words of the Earl of Reading C.J. in Eaglesham v. McMaster \[1920\] 2 K.B. 169, it is not the court which says that the petitioners shall not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves have so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing they cannot complain if the respondents hold them to their bargain.  It may well be that the action commenced by the Osei Bonsus cannot succeed without a winding-up order being made, but as far as the objection taken by Mr. Kom to these proceedings is concerned, I am of the view that it is unanswerable and must be upheld. The application for the official winding-up of the company is accordingly dismissed, and the interim orders made by this court on 12 February 1979 are discharged.  DECISION  Preliminary objection upheld.  Petition dismissed.  S. O.  IN RE ENNIN ALIAS BODOM (DECD.); NTI v. SERWAAH \[1980\] GLR 809�814  HIGH COURT, KUMASI  18 DECEMBER 1979  ROGER KORSAH J.

Administration of estates�Letters of administration�Caveat�Caveatrix claiming legal title to one of several properties devised wholly to applicant�Whether issue can be determined in an application for letters of administration.  HEADNOTES  The applicant brought this application for the grant of letters of administration with the will of his father E annexed. E by his will appointed one A as the sole executor and devised his whole estate to the applicant. A entered upon and managed the estate without taking out probate. The executor A, however, died in 1976 and the applicant applied for the grant of letters of administration. Before the grant could be made, M and S caveated the grant of letters to the applicant. M claimed that as the head of the family and successor to the late E, he was entitled to be granted the letters of administration jointly with the applicant. But when it became clear that unlike a situation of death intestate, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed might be made to a devisee of the whole estate without the concurrence or joinder of the head of family, he discontinued his claim. S. however, caveated and in her affidavit claimed that a building and the land around it which were devised to the applicant were her \[p.810\] ancestral family properties and therefore the testator had no legal title in them to clothe anyone with. The applicant and S., the caveatrix, failed to come to an agreement as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. And on the issue whether the court was bound to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveatrix,  Held, granting the application:  (1) the decision that whenever a caveat was filed and the caveator failed to come to an agreement with the applicant, the court must order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator did not meet the ends of justice; it put a restrictive interpretation on Order 60, r. 21 (2) of L.N. 140A of 1954. It was only when the caveator had established an interest, disclosed by his affidavit of interest, that it became obligatory for a judge to order a writ of summons to be issued by the applicant against the caveator. In the instant case, no such interest had been shown by the caveatrix. Dicta of Archer J.A. in In re Arthur (Decd.); Abakah v. Attah-Hagan \[1972\] 1 G.L.R. 435 at p. 447, C.A.; of Lord Selborne in Julius v. Oxford (Bishop of) (1880) 5 App.Cas. 214 at p. 235, H.L. and Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford \[1929\] 2 K.B. 180 applied. Nimoh v. Acheampong \[1959\] G.L.R. 49, S.C. criticised.  (2) If the property claimed by the caveatrix did not belong to the testator, the devise in the will would not confer any interest in the property on the beneficiary; for the legal interest in the property would not be affected by the grant of letters of administration to the applicant. Since the caveatrix claimed one small property out of several others devised to the applicant, she could therefore not claim to have the better right to the grant of letters of administration. The issue arising between the caveatrix and the applicant was who was entitled to the legal title to the property claimed. That issue could not be determined in an action for letters of administration.  CASES REFERRED TO  (1) Nimoh v. Acheampong \[1959\] G.L.R. 49, S.C.  (2) Arthur (Decd.), In re; Abakah v.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  ACTION to determine the person who was entitled to the grant of letters of administration with will annexed. The facts are sufficiently stated in the judgment.  COUNSEL  Hayfron-Benjamin for the applicant.  Asiedu-Basua for the caveatrix.  JUDGMENT OF ROGER KORSAH J.  The applicant�s father died about fifteen years ago. By his will dated 12 April 1947 he appointed one Emmanuel Kofi \[p.811\] Agyepong of Abuakwa Kumasi, as his sole executor, and devised the whole of his estate to the applicant. The executor entered upon the estate and managed it without taking out probate. With his neglect of the farms comprising part of the estate, the said farms reverted to fallow land. Emmanuel Kofi Agyepong, the executor, died in or around 1976, and on 19 August 1977 the applicant filed an ex parte application for the grant of letters of administration with the will of Paul Ennin annexed. Notices pending the grant were duly filed in compliance with the orders of this court.  On 20 June 1979, before any grant could be made by the court, two persons: Opanin Kwabena Mmire and Madam Amma Serwaah both of Abuakwa, Kumasi, jointly caveated the grant of letters to the applicant. The caveator and caveatrix filed their separate affidavits of interest in response to the warning issued by the applicant.  The caveator claims that he is the head of family and the present successor to late Paul Ennin and that the applicant should at least have joined him in the application for the grant of letters of administration. But his claim was not pressed to conclusion when it was pointed out that, unlike the case of a death intestate, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed may be made to a devisee of the whole estate without the concurrence or the joinder of the head of family, particularly as he has no interest whatsoever in the estate.  The claim of the caveatrix was another matter. Her claim was that a building which was devised by the late Paul Ennin and the plot of land around it were the ancestral properties of her family and that Paul Ennin had no legal estate in them to clothe anyone with.  The applicant moved the court to grant letters of administration with will annexed to him. He, the applicant, and the caveatrix failed to come to an agreement as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. The High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), Order 60, r. 21 (2) provides:  �(2) Failing the parties coming to such an agreement, however the Court may order that the applicant do issue a writ of summons against the caveator within a specified period from the date of such order, to determine the issue as to who is entitled to a grant of probate or letters of administration, as the case may be.�  (The emphasis is mine.) This rule received interpretation in Nimoh v. Acheampong \[1959\] G.L.R. 49, S.C. In that case, two caveators failed to come to agreement with the appellant for letters of administration as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. When the applicant�s motion came on, the judge, pronouncing \[p.812\] that on the affidavits, it was clear that the first caveator had no locus standi and that his intervention was �a bare-faced try-on,� ordered that joint letters of administration should issue to the applicant and the second caveator. On appeal by the first caveator, them Supreme Court per van Lare Ag.C.J. said at p. 50:  �The Court was therefore bound under the provision of Order 60, Rule 21 (2) of L.N. 140A to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveators within a specified period. Instead of proceeding as required by the Rules the learned judge ordered Letters of Administration to issue jointly to the applicant and the second caveator.�  The court therefore set aside the order appealed from.  This decision means that whenever a caveat is filed and the caveator fails to come to an agreement with the applicant, even though it may be clear from the affidavit of interest that the caveator has no interest in the estate, the court must order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator. Thus �the court may order� in Order 60, r. 21 (2) was interpreted to mean �the court shall order.� Unfortunately, the judgment is very short and does not contain the reasoning by which the decision was arrived at, that the word �may� should be interpreted as �shall.� This interpretation has been the subject of justifiable criticism by Archer J.A. in the case of In re Arthur (Decd.); Abakah v. Attah-Hagan \[1972\] 1 G.L.R. 435 at p. 447, C.A. Admittedly, the word �may� is permissive and empowering but has sometimes been construed as obligatory. As Lord Selborne said in Julius v. Oxford (Bishop of) (1880) 5 App.Cas. 214 at p. 235. H.L.:  �The question whether a Judge, or a public officer, to whom a power is given by such words, is bound to use it upon any particular occasion, or in any particular manner, must be solved aliunde, and, in general, it is to be solved from the context, from the particular provisions, or from the general scope and objects, of the enactment conferring the power.�  In fact, the whole scope and intention of the provision must be considered and there is no cut and dried rule by which the distinction between discretion and obligation can be drawn. So in Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford \[1929\] 2 K.B. 180 it was held that by section 138 of the English County Courts Act, 1888, �may order� are enabling words, but where a legal right to possession has been established on the part of the landlord, it is the duty of the judge to make an order for possession.  \[p.813\]  What then is the general scope of the objects of the rules in relation to caveats? The first sentence in Order 60, r. 17 states that ""A caveat may be entered by any person having an interest in the estate of a deceased . . .� (The emphasis is mine.) If a person who has no interest whatsoever in the estate of a deceased person were to file a caveat, would a judge be bound to order the applicant for a letters to issue a writ of summons merely because the caveator refuses to agree that he has no interest? Again Order 60, r. 19 enjoins the caveator to file an affidavit of interest. What is the purpose of filing an affidavit of interest if the court, even though the affidavit discloses no interest in the estate of the deceased, is bound to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator? In my view, an affidavit of interest is filed to enable the court to determine whether the caveator has any interest in the estate. And the court may make an order dependent upon whether or not the caveator has disclosed in his affidavit an interest in the property of the deceased.  Finally, under Order 60, r. 21 (2) the writ of summons is issued against the caveator for the resolution of only one issue: �to determine the issue as to who is entitled to a grant of probate or letters of administration, as the case may be.� If by the affidavit of interest it can be ascertained that the caveator has no interest, is it reasonable to expect a court to make an order which will lead to a protracted trial the conclusion of which is already known? As in Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford (supra), it is only when the caveator has established an interest in the estate of the deceased, that it becomes obligatory for a judge to order that a writ of summons be issued by the applicant against the caveator. In my view, the ends of justice cannot be met by putting such a restrictive interpretation on Order 60, r. 21 (2) as was done in the Nimoh case.  As Archer J.A. said in the In re Arthur case at p. 447 after giving good and substantial reasons:  �I do not think that the word �may� in the rule \[i.e. Order 60, r. 21 (2)\] should be strictly construed as conferring an unfettered discretion on the court. In my view, it means that the court has power to order or not to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons. It does not mean that in all cases, the court should order the issue of a writ. It is this transformation of the word �may� into a mandatory command which has resulted in unnecessary litigation in the past.�  The decisions in both the Nimoh case and In re Arthur, I am happy to say, are decisions of courts of co-equal jurisdiction. As a result, \[p.814\] I am free to follow the one I favour. And I choose the view of the law as expressed by Archer J.A.  Counsel conceded that the first caveator had no interest in the property of the deceased devised under the will, but he maintained that as the caveatrix claimed one of several properties devised by the will to be her ancestral property, she has established a sufficient interest in the estate, and the court is bound to order that the plaintiff do issue a writ of summons against the caveatrix on the authority of the decision in the Nimoh case. In the first place if the property she claims did not belong to the testator, then the devise in the will does not confer any interest in respect of that property on the beneficiary. Her legal interest in that property is therefore not affected by the grant of letters to the applicant. Secondly, since her claim is in respect of one small property out of several others devised to the applicant, she cannot claim to have the better right to the grant of letters of administration. Thirdly, since she says that the legal title to the property she claims rests in her, the only issue: �the determination of who is entitled to a grant of letters,� does not arise between her and the applicant. The issue which arises between her and the applicant is who is entitled to the legal title to the property she claims. As this issue cannot be determined in an action for letters of administration, I order that the caveats filed by both caveator and caveatrix be removed and that letters of administration with will annexed be issued to the applicant. I award costs of �200 in favour of the applicant against both caveators.  DECISION  Caveat removed.  Application for letters of administration with will annexed granted.  D. F. L.  SARKODEE J.

HEADNOTES  The plaintiff was the customary successor and the defendant, a widow of the late JA who died intestate on 25 November 1971 and was possessed of a block of six flats in Takoradi. The defendant after the death of her husband continued to reside in one of the flats in which she, her husband and the children had lived immediately before his death. She also collected rents in respect of two other flats in the building and used the accrued rents to maintain herself and the children. On 13 March 1973 the plaintiff was alone granted letters of administration to administer the estate of the late JA. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought the instant action for an order that: (a) the defendant should return all the keys to the flats and (b) an account in respect of all the rents so far collected by the defendant in respect of the flats. Whilst the instant action was pending, the defendant applied for and was granted letters of administration jointly with the plaintiff under section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63). At the hearing, counsel for the defendant argued that as a co-administrator the plaintiff could not maintain the action against the defendant in her new capacity as a co-administratrix. But counsel for the plaintiff submitted that at the time the writ was issued against the defendant, she was not an administratrix and that during the period she collected rents she was an executor de son tort and could be sued for any amount in her hands.  \[p.758\]  Held, dismissing the action:  (1) the defendant as widow of the intestate at customary law had a beneficial life interest in her husband's estate. It was for that reason that the court granted her power to administer the estate jointly with the plaintiff under section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63), to enable her to protect the interest of her children who were then minors. The subsequent grant of letters of administration to the defendant perfected her title and related back to the death of her husband since her acts were done in the interest and for the benefit of the estate. The defendant was therefore not liable to account to the plaintiff. Ingall v. Moran \[1944\] K.B. 160 and Chetty v. Chetty \[1916\] 1 A.C. 603, P.C. cited.  (2) The possessory life interest of a widow and her children was a right which was prior to any enjoyed by the customary successor or the deceased's family. The right to occupy the flat as a whole should be respected by the successor and the deceased's family. Abebreseh v. Kaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 46 cited.  (3) The appointment of the plaintiff as successor to the estate made him a representative of his family and a trustee and caretaker of the marriage. Under customary law the death of either spouse or both did not determine the union of the two families established by the marriage. The duty of the husband to provide accommodation and maintenance for his wife and children devolved upon his family or successor. That responsibility could only determine upon the death of the wife or the determination of the marriage in a lawful manner. Where the successor failed or refused to maintain the children of the deceased and their mother assumed that responsibility, she was entitled to sue the successor to recover any amount so spent. Since the plaintiff, as successor to the estate, failed to educate and provide reasonable maintenance for the children and their mother had to discharge those responsibilities, she became at common law an agent of necessity and therefore entitled to be reimbursed out of the estate. In addition, a mother had a right to claim from her husband or his successor expenses she incurred in maintaining and providing medical treatment for herself and her children. Manu v. Kuma \[1963\] 1 G.L.R. 464 at p. 469, S.C. applied.  Per curiam. The defendant is now an old woman and is deteriorating in health. There is no question that she could re-marry and it appears she has no intention of taking a formal divorce from her husband's family. It would, therefore, be unfair and against good conscience in such circumstances for the successor or the husband's family to divorce her formally and give her a send off.

The facts are sufficiently stated in the judgment.  COUNSEL  Hayfron-Benjamin for the plaintiff.  Sekyi-Hughes for the defendant.  JUDGMENT OF SARKODEE J.  The plaintiff is the customary successor and the defendant, one of two widows of the late John Arthur who died intestate on 25 November 1971, possessed of a block of six flats, House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, which was his self-acquired property. After the death of her husband the defendant continued to reside and still resides in one of the flats in which she, her husband and children lived immediately before his death. Also she collected rents from tenants who occupied other flats in the building. On 13 March 1973 the plaintiff alone was granted letters of administration to the estate of the deceased. Armed with this and aided by other members of the deceased's family, he demanded all keys to the flats including the one occupied by the defendant. He also asked her to account for the rents she had collected. The defendant surrendered the keys to all the flats except the one she occupied but refused to render accounts. The plaintiff was not satisfied and in effect was determined to throw the defendant and her children out of the flat in which she and her husband had lived for many years. In April 1973 the plaintiff instituted this action claiming:  ""(a) an order for the return of all keys to House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, to the plaintiff which said keys are with the defendant and which the defendant has refused to hand over despite repeated demands; and  (b) an order for accounts in respect of all moneys belonging to the estate which have come to the defendant since the death of late John Arthur and payment of same to the plaintiff who is the successor and administrator of the estate of the late John Arthur.""  Whilst this suit was pending, the defendant, in view of the harassment she and her children were suffering from the hands of the plaintiff and her husband's family, and in particular fearing that the children who were then minors would not be maintained by her husband's successor, applied for and was granted letters of administration jointly with the plaintiff. Accordingly, she continued to collect rents out of which she maintained herself and her children. That was the situation until the court appointed a receiver and manager to the estate of John Arthur in July 1974.  \[p.760\]  The defendant says that the keys she holds are those to her flat. She explained that it was when the plaintiff refused to pay the school fees of her children and the out-goings such as electricity and water bills and rates in respect of the house that she in her capacity as one of the administrators acted and carried out those important duties. She says further that since November 1976 her children by the deceased have not been provided with maintenance. She, therefore, in her counterclaim asked the plaintiff as an administrator of her husband's estate to render accounts and for an order that the plaintiff out of the estate provides reasonable maintenance for the children.  When the plaintiff applied to the court for the grant of letters of administration, the defendant entered a caveat and subsequently made serious allegations set out in the ruling of Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) delivered on 10 April 1974. As the parties could not reach agreement the court ordered the applicant to take out summons within two weeks. When that was done pleadings were ordered and issues agreed upon and the case was set down for trial. After various adjournments, the parties announced a settlement the terms of which were:  ""(1) That letters of administration be granted to the plaintiff herein called Isaac Augustus Hayford.  (2) That the defendant shall be granted �50 a month from the estate for her maintenance.  (3) That the defendant and her three children by the deceased shall be granted a flat consisting of one half of a floor in House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, for her apartment.  (4) That the plaintiff shall be responsible for the payment of school fees and maintenance of the deceased's three children with the defendant.  (5) That rates and taxes and out-goings on House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, shall be borne by the estate.""  Upon these terms the court made the order for the issue of letters of administration which was done on 13 March 1973. Despite this settlement, the plaintiff, one month later, sealed a writ to commence the present action demanding keys including those for the defendant's flat. On 9 July 1973 when the matter came up for hearing counsel for the plaintiff suggested an amicable settlement. The court then ordered certain investigations to be conducted which revealed that the defendant would not be occupying a complete flat with her children if she surrendered keys to the bedroom, the sitting hall and the kitchen. It was after this report that the parties \[p.761\] appeared before Charles Crabbe J. who after referring to section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63), the defendant was appointed administratrix in addition to the plaintiff.  Mr. Sekyi-Hughes, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that in as much as the parties are co-administrators the action against the defendant is not maintenable. As a general rule if there are several executors and administrators, they have a joint and entire interest in the estate of the testator or intestate which cannot be divided. Accordingly, they cannot maintain an action at law to protect the deceased's property against one another the reason being that a person cannot sue himself either alone or jointly with, others: see Ellis v. Kerr \[1910\] 1 Ch. 529. Mr. Hayfron-Benjamin on his part for the plaintiff argued that at the time the writ was issued the defendant was not administratrix and therefore the defendant when she collected rents from 1971 to May 1973 was in law an executor de son tort and could therefore be sued for any amount in her hand.  It is not disputed that the property of an intestate does not, vest in the intestate's administrator until letters of administration have been granted to him. An executor de son tort is liable to be sued by the rightful representative. Also the defendant as a widow of the intestate, has at customary law a beneficial life interest in her husband's estate. In this regard, she has a right to protect the estate. There are cases where letters of administration in similar circumstances have been held to relate back to the death of the intestate so as to give validity to acts done before the letters of administration were granted, provided these acts were done in the interest and for the benefit of the deceased's estate: see Ingall v. Moran \[1944\] K.B. 160, C.A. In such cases the subsequent grant perfected the defendant's title and related back to the death of the deceased: see Chetty v. Chetty \[1916\] 1 A.C. 603, P.C. It was however held in Ingall v. Moran (supra) that the doctrine of relation back could be applied to representation which was incompetent when the writ was issued. The defendant would not have obtained the grant of letters of administration but for her interest in her husband's children. The court granted her power to administer the estate jointly with the plaintiff in accordance with section 77 of Act 63 to enable her protect the interests of her children who were then minors. Her duty was to see that the interest of those young ones was not trampled upon by their father's successor. I hold therefore that the defendant is not liable to account to the plaintiff. Even if I were to hold that the action was maintenable whatever the defendant did was in the interest of her late husband's \[p.762\] estate. The subsequent grant perfected the defendant's title and related back to the death of the deceased.  The plaintiff claims from the defendant all the keys to House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi. From his own evidence it seems the plaintiff was able to collect all the keys except those to the garage attached to the defendant's flat and the key to what has been described as the stranger's room. The plaintiff accepted as a condition to the defendant withdrawing the caveat that she and her children should continue to live in the flat. The garage and the stranger's room form part of the flat and were used as part of the whole flat and enjoyed with other amenities in the flat during the lifetime of the deceased. That apart, Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) caused an inspection of the flat to be made and it became clear that it would be difficult for the defendant and her children to occupy only half of the flat. The defendant, her husband and her children lived in that flat for many years. The possessory life interest of the widow and her children is a right which is prior to any enjoyed by the customary successor or the widower's family: see Abebreseh v. Kaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 46 at p. 61. It would be unreasonable to compel the defendant to surrender the keys. The right to occupy the flat as a whole should be respected by the successor and the deceased's family. She and her children should not surrender the keys to the flat. Rather they should occupy the whole flat as she and her husband enjoyed during his lifetime.  The plaintiff by his appointment as customary successor became a representative of his family and a trustee or caretaker of the marriage. Under customary law, the death of either spouse or both does not determine the union of two families established by the marriage. Thus the husband's duty to provide accommodation and maintenance for his wife and children devolves upon his family or successor, a responsibility which can only determine upon the death of the wife or upon the determination of the marriage in a lawful manner: see Ollennu, The Law of Testate and Intestate Succession in Ghana chapter, 29. Where the successor fails or refuses to maintain the children of the deceased and their mother assumes that responsibility, she is entitled to sue the successor to recover any amount so spent. It was held in Manu v. Kuma \[1963\] 1 G.L.R. 464 at p. 469, S.C. that:  ""A mother is, in the absence of the father or the father's successor, the natural guardian of her infant child, and is entitled to sue on their behalf for their maintenance or for any other relief. Therefore the defendant, successor to the father, having neglected the children proper the person to sue is the mother \[p.763\] the plaintiff . . .; the plaintiff is therefore an agent of necessity of the defendant and is entitled at common law to be reimbursed as to the amount she was obliged to expend on her children.""  The plaintiff as successor to the estate of John Arthur failed to educate and provide reasonable maintenance for his children. It therefore became the burden of their mother to discharge those responsibilities. As an agent of necessity she is entitled at common law to be reimbursed out of her husband's estate the amount she spent on the children. Apart from the common law, a mother has a right to claim from her husband or his successor expenses she may incur for maintaining and providing medical treatment for herself and her children. The defendant has been responsible for the maintenance of herself and her children since the death of her husband in 1971 and has been paying the children's school fees, the plaintiff having neglected to perform those duties. The plaintiff does not deny this but says that he failed to look after the children because the children of the defendant were hostile to him. But the undisputed fact is that the defendant and her children could not trust the plaintiff. It appears the very first time after the death of John Arthur when the plaintiff entered house No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, that he went there solely to demand from the defendant keys for the flat and indeed threatened to eject the widow and her children out of the flat. It was the plaintiff's persistent demand for the keys and the widow and her children's determination to protect their rights as owners of the life interest in the deceased's self-acquired property that started the quarrels between him and the defendant and her children. The plaintiff cannot be heard to say he refused to maintain the children because of their attitude. They had to act in defence of their rights.  The defendant's eldest child has since been married but the other two, though over 21 years in each case, are undergoing full time education and ought therefore to be maintained out of their father's estate. The defendant estimates that the children spent about fifteen cedis a day. That amount was given before the present day rate of inflation. I would therefore raise that amount to twenty cedis a day. I order that this sum should be paid out of the estate to the defendant and her children for as long as she remains a widow and the children up to the age of 25 years each or cease full time education whichever is earlier. The successor shall pay the school fees of the children.  The defendant started to collect rents for the estate as soon as her husband died until the court appointed a receiver and manager. She admitted that she spent some moneys out of the rents for the children.  \[p.764\]  I do not therefore think she is entitled to be reimbursed for expenses she incurred.  The defendant is now an old woman and is deteriorating in health. There is no question that she could re-marry and it appears she has no intention of taking a formal divorce from her husband's family. It would, therefore, be unfair and against good conscience in such circumstances for the successor or the husband's family to divorce her formally and give her a send off. The defendant lived with the deceased husband for many years when he was a regional commissioner and no doubt ably played the part of a regional commissioner's wife. It would be inequitable to reduce the size of the flat as she enjoyed together with her family and make her share it with another family. That in my view would amount to a lowering of her standard of living. I do not therefore think that she would be asking for too much, and I accordingly direct that the life interest of the widow and her children should cover the entire flat as occupied by her and her husband during his lifetime including the garage, sitting hall, stranger's room and the kitchen together with its amenities.  Costs �1,500 to the defendant.  DECISION  Judgment for the defendant.  D. F.

"Courts�Jurisdiction�Co-ordinate�Decisions or orders by courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction�Circumstances under which a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction ought not to entertain an application previously dealt with by another�High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), Order 39, r. 4.  HEADNOTES  The plaintiff-company (hereinafter called the plaintiffs) issued a writ against the defendant, a director and shareholder of the company, claiming the return of some plant equipment and goods alleged to be in the possession of the defendant and damages amounting to �7 million. In a statement of defence filed, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the Ghana Government had a lien on the properties being claimed by the plaintiffs. Believing that the defence did not constitute an answer to the claim, the plaintiffs brought an application for an order striking out paragraphs 4-9 of the statement of defence and a consequential order for entry of judgment on admissions or in default of defence. In opposition, the defendant filed, inter alia, a judgment of Ampiah J. (as he then was) in which the defendant was a plaintiff and the other three directors of the company were the defendants. In that judgment Ampiah J. made a consent order that a firm of chartered accountants should audit and value the properties of the company, a report of which should be submitted to the court. He also ordered that no one should dispose of the company's properties pending the submission of the report. The defendant contended that in the light of that ruling, the application was incompetent. Adadevoh J. who heard the motion relied on the ruling of Ampiah J. given on 9 November 1984 and ruled that the defence filed by the defendant raised triable issues to be gone into by the court and that the case be heard on the merits and therefore dismissed the application. Exactly one year later, the plaintiffs filed the same application in the High Court in the same terms, word for word, seeking the same remedies before another High Court judge, Lutterodt J. Six months before Lutterodt J. sat on the motion, the plaintiffs filed a supplementary affidavit to which a judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) was attached, seeking to use that judgment as a new material introducing new circumstances that justified the rehearing of the application by Lutterodt J. The latter whose attention was not drawn to the earlier ruling of Adadevoh J., who had by then left Accra, granted the application and struck out the relevant offending paragraphs of the defence and entered judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that there was a subsisting ruling of Adadevoh J., as a judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction, which had not been reversed on appeal; consequently� it was irregular for Lutterodt J. to entertain the motion. The Court of Appeal by a two to one majority decision dismissed the appeal. On further appeal by the defendant to the Supreme Court,  Held, dismissing the appeal (Adade and Aikins JJ.S.C. dissenting): (1) there were exceptions to the rule that a judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction ought not to \[p.651\] entertain an application which had been previously dealt with by another. First, Order 39, r. 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A) envisaged that in certain situations judgments and orders might have to be reviewed by a differently constituted court; and secondly, the setting aside by the Court of Appeal of the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) had created a new situation which justified a fresh recourse to the court. With Adadevoh J. no longer in Accra, Lutterodt J. could have done nothing else but to deal with the application. Consequently, her decision striking out the offending paragraphs of the defence and entering judgment for the plaintiffs as affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal was right. Republic v. High Court Judge, Koforidua; Ex parte Nsowaa \[1989-90\] 2 G.L.R. 677 S.C. and Vanderpuye v. Nartey \[1977\] 1 G.L.R .428 at 430, C.A. per Amissah cited,  Per Francois J.S.C. It seems to me that whatever the merits of the ruling of Adadevoh J., that ruling collapsed alongside the superstructure that was Ampiah J's ruling and equally denuded Adadevoh J.'s . . . The ruling of the Court of Appeal completely demolished any force in Ampiah J.'s ruling of any weight. In any event . . . a new situation had arisen immediately the defendant conceded that his pleadings disclosed no answer to the plaint and the matter should be resolved by other means. When these floundered the defendants case collapsed.  Per Adade J.S.C. dissenting. (i) It strikes me that if Lutterodt J. had seen the ruling of Adadevoh J. her reaction to the application then before her might well have been different. Be that as it may, the ruling \[of Adadevoh J.\] that the case be heard on the merits not having been set aside, and being an order of the High Court in the same case, Lutterodt J. in the same High Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to give a snap judgment without hearing the case on the merits. The impression must on no account be created that litigants and their lawyers can run from judge to judge until they get the ruling and orders they want. There can be no surer recipe for chaos and confusion in the courts. I would not subscribe to a precedent that points in that direction.  (ii) Although her \[Lutterodt J's\] attention was called to the supplementary affidavit \[by the plaintiffs\] the judgment of the Court of Appeal was nowhere mentioned, let alone considered, in her reserved ruling, implying that as far as she was concerned, the decision of the Court of Appeal had nothing to do with any changed circumstances. Her assumption of jurisdiction cannot therefore be justified by recourse to changed circumstances or new matters.  Per Aikins J.S.C. also dissenting. It is my view that since the ruling and order or both of Adadevoh J. on 4 March 1985 had not been set aside on appeal or otherwise, Lutterodt J. lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the fresh identical application filed on 4 March 1986 seeking the very reliefs which had been refused and dismissed.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  APPEAL against the majority decision of the Court of Appeal which had affirmed the decision of Lutterodt J. striking out the offending paragraphs of the statement of defence and entering judgment in favour of the plaintiffs on admissions or in default of defence in a claim for, inter alia, the return of plant and machinery. The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Amua-Sekyi, Francois and Adade JJ.S.C.  COUNSEL  E. D. Kom, SAG (with him George Kom and Mavis Odoi-Sykes) for the appellant.  W. A. N. Adumua-Bossman for the respondents.  JUDGMENT OF AMUAH-SEKYI J.S.C.  The plaintiffs are civil engineers and the defendant was their general manager. In 1984 the plaintiffs issued a writ against the defendant claiming the following reliefs:  ""1. The return of the machinery, equipment and other goods the property of the plaintiffs listed in the attached letter dated 14 September 1984 from W.A.N. Adumua-Bossman to the defendant.  2\. �7 million damages for the wrongful detention of the said listed goods.  3\. Mesne profits as from 17 September 1984 at the rate of �1,885,000 per month of 20 working days or in the \[p.653\] alternative at the rate of �94,250 per day until judgment herein or the delivery up of possession of the said listed goods.  4\. Further or other relief as in the circumstances may be just, including, in particular, a perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, whether by himself, his servants, agents or privies whomsoever, from retaining or using any one or more of the said listed goods for any purpose whatsoever whilst in his possession, order, custody or disposition.""  The plaintiffs filed a statement of claim setting out the facts giving rise to the suit and the defendant filed what he said was a defence to the action.  Believing that the defence did not constitute an answer to the matters alleged in the statement of claim, the plaintiffs applied to the court to strike out paragraphs 4 to 9 of the defence and enter judgment for them. The application was opposed by the defendant who alleged, as part of his case, that he had earlier sued the plaintiffs and obtained a ruling against them. He exhibited a ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) to his affidavit and contended that it rendered the current suit incompetent. The application for judgment came before Adadevoh J. who refused it. Significantly, he referred to, and relied on, the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) which bears the date, 9 November 1984.  Both parties then knew that the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) was on appeal to the Court of Appeal. On 25 July 1985 that court gave a judgment allowing the appeal and setting aside the various orders made under the ruling. When, therefore, the plaintiffs decided to have another try they averred in paragraphs 3-6 of their supplementary affidavit as follows:  ""3. Since filing the plaintiff-company's similar and unsuccessful motion on 14 January 1985 the legal relationship between the plaintiff-company and the defendant, its former director and expert employee, has been radically affected or altered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 25 July 1985 in Civ. App. No. 33/1985 from the ruling dated 9 November 1984 of Ampiah J. (as he then was) in the High Court, Accra in suit No Misc 131/83.  4\. I attach hereto, marked GKAA 1, a photocopy of the certified final order made by the Court of Appeal in the said appeal.  5\. I further attach hereto, marked GKAA 2, a photocopy of the certified whole judgment dated 25 July 1985 of the Court of Appeal in the said appeal.  6\. I am advised and verily believe that the said copy order and the said copy judgment are both relevant matters to be taken \[p.654\] into consideration in the said motion filed by the plaintiff-company.""  The application came before Lutterodt J. As before, the parties were represented by Mr Adumua-Bossman for the plaintiffs and Mr. Kom for the defendant. The record shows that Mr. Kom agreed that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment for the reliefs indorsed on their writ. His only plea was that after the Court of Appeal had allowed the appeal, the parties had appeared before Ampiah J. (as he then was) in this suit and agreed that an account be taken so that the plaintiffs might buy out the defendant who was himself a shareholder. He asked that this agreement be enforced. Having heard counsel, Lutterodt J. struck out the offending paragraphs and ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs.  The defendant appealed from that decision to the Court of Appeal. Wuaku J.S.C. sitting as an additional judge of the Court of Appeal, and Essiem J.A. dismissed the appeal. Lamptey J.A. dissented and, although the question of jurisdiction had not been raised, held that it was improper for Lutterodt J. to have entertained the application and that her ruling was null and void. He relied on Anane v. Efriyea (1940) 6 W.A.C.A. 169 in which a plea of res judicata having been unsuccessfully raised in the court of the Chief Commissioner of Ashanti, was raised again four years later before a differently-constituted court and sustained. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal said at 170:  ""It is simply the blunt and inescapable truth that the Commissioner's Court having given an interlocutory judgment in a particular suit that judgment stands unless in so far as it may be reviewed by the particular Judge who pronounced it or altered by a competent Appeal Court. No other Judge of the Provincial Commissioner's Court can come along and say�either ex proprio motu or, on application of one of the parties, �'I do not agree with the interlocutory judgment already pronounced by this Court and I shall ignore it and compel the parties to litigate the same question afresh.'�  The later ruling on the issue of res judicata was set aside as void. But the court did not stop there. They went on to consider whether the first ruling was right and, having decided that it was wrong, set it aside and remitted the case to the court below with a direction that the claim of the plaintiffs be dismissed.  A similar situation arose in Republic v. Circuit Court Judge, Tamale; Ex parte Volta \[1984-86\] 1 G.L.R. 367, CA and Republic v. Circuit Court Judge, Tamale; Ex parte Volta \[1984-86\] 1 G.L.R. 372, \[p.655\] S.C. In the Court of Appeal decision (supra) the facts were that the appellant, Zieche, was charged with offences under the Wildlife Reserves Regulations, 1971 (L.I. 710) before the Circuit Court, Tamale. He was acquitted and the judge made an order that the hunting rifle found on him and seized by Volta, Senior Game Warden of the Mole National Park, be returned to him. Volta applied to the High Court, Tamale for an order of certiorari to quash the restitution order for want of jurisdiction. Dove J. dismissed the application; but eight months later Sapong J. set aside the order of Dove J. as void and quashed the restitution order made by the circuit court. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was held that the order of Sapong J. was void. When the appeal against the decision of Dove J. also came tip for hearing it was set aside as wrong, and the restitution order of the circuit judge was quashed.  There are exceptions to the rule that a judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction ought not to entertain an application which has been previously dealt with by another. In Republic v. High Court, Koforidua; Ex parte Nsowaa \[1989-90\] 2 G.L.R. 677, SC post, this court drew attention to the fact that Order 39, r. 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A) envisages that in certain situations judgments and orders may have to be reviewed by a differently constituted court. The point was also made by the Court of Appeal in Vanderpuye v. Nartey \[1977\] 1 G.L.R. 428, C.A. There, an application for interim reliefs was refused by Griffiths-Randolph J. after he had heard both parties. Subsequently, it was repeated before Edusei J. (as he then was) who held that the matter having been already dealt with by another judge, he could not interfere. On appeal, it was held that as he new matters had arisen since the first decision was given, Edusei J. (as he then was) ought to have entertained the application and given a decision on the merits. The court per Amissah J.A. at 430 said:  ""If there is new matter which changes the positions of the parties, a court should look at it to determine whether the prayer in a motion for interlocutory relief ought to be granted despite the fact that a similar motion has already been disposed of in relation to the same question. The courts must be left to determine at their discretion when a party is using their processes to pursue his frivolous or vexatious ends.""  The setting aside by the Court of Appeal of the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) had created a new situation which justified a fresh recourse to the court. With Adadevoh J. no longer stationed in Accra one wonders what else Lutterodt J. could have done but to deal with the application.  \[p.656\]  The power of the court to strike out pleadings is governed by Orders 19, r. 29 and 25, r. 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A). Order 19, r. 29 provides:  ""29. The Court or a Judge may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any indorsement or pleading which may be unnecessary or scandalous or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action; and may in any such case, if they or he shall think fit, order the costs of the application to be paid as between solicitor and client.""  And Order 25, r 4 also provides:  ""4. The Court or a Judge may order any pleading to be struck out, on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or answer, and in any such case or in case of the action or defence being shown by the pleadings to be frivolous or vexatious, the Court or a Judge may order the action to be stayed or dismissed, or judgment to be entered accordingly, as may be just.""  There is, of course, additionally an inherent jurisdiction to stay or dismiss actions and to strike out pleadings which are vexatious or frivolous or an abuse of the process of the court. These or similar powers were exercised in Onalaja v Oshimubi (1949) 12 W.A.C.A. 503 and Onwonka v. Minaise (1952) 14 W.A.C.A. 77. There is nothing arbitrary in them; rather they are designed to save parties the expense of long and costly trials when there is no cause of action or no reasonable defence, especially in cases where the issue can be resolved by simply looking at the pleadings. The courts must be astute to prevent abuse of the rules of procedure which are designed to ensure the fair trial of genuine claims and defence only.  Put simply, the case for the plaintiffs was that the defendant had in his custody and under his control various machines and equipment belonging to them and which he had diverted to undertake work for a rival company formed by him. The defendant admitted that fact, but contended in paragraphs 4-9 of his so-called defence that the Ghana government and its agencies had a lien on the machines and equipment. Clearly, this was no answer to the claim. The mystery is how Adadevoh J. came to be misled into thinking that there were any issues to be tried. Even though the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) declared that the affairs of the plaintiff-company were being conducted in an oppressive manner and granted an injunction it did not make the defendant the custodian of the machines and equipment for the Ghana government.  \[p.657\]  I am satisfied that, whatever may be the merits of the counterclaim of the defendant, the defence filed by him did not disclose any reasonable answer to the claim of the plaintiffs. The decision of Lutterodt J. was therefore right and ought to be affirmed. This means that the appeal fails, and it is hereby dismissed.  JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS J.S.C.  I agree with the leading opinion read by my brother Amua-Sekyi J.S.C. and only wish to add a few words of my own. This matter which began as a simple attempt by a company to enlist the court's aid to suppress a violation of trust by one of its directors, has been transformed into an unsavory legal conflict with the unacceptable result of perpetuating the mischief complained about.  The facts briefly are that the plaintiff-respondents (hereinafter called the plaintiffs), an engineering company, sought to restrain one of its directors, the defendant-appellant (hereinafter called the defendant) from utilising the company's assets to his advantage in a rival business operation. The defendant was in charge of the plaintiffs' contract termed ""The Weija Irrigation Project."" This was a project funded by the European Development Fund under the aegis of the Government of Ghana. The participation of these third parties enabled the plaintiffs to acquire heavy machinery for the company's use at the project site, with arrangements for settling the cost later.  In 1989 the plaintiff-company learnt that its servant, the defendant, had set up a rival company, Ladco Ltd., which was using the company's equipment for competitive work. It was the unheeded protest at the breach of the fiduciary relationship of the defendant with the company and the failure to return the equipment of the company that provoked the suit.  The above facts were stated in meticulous detail in the plaintiffs' claim. The defendant's response was merely to define his status as a managing director with one-third equity shareholding in the company. The defence admitted unequivocally that the defendant was appointed by the company ""to be the director in charge of the Weija Irrigation Pilot Project and to be the sole agent for the plaintiff-company in respect of this project.""  Save for these averments, which appeared in the first two paragraphs of the defence, the defendant made no pretence at answering the claim. On the contrary, the defendant appeared to project a gratuitous stance as an agent for and protector of government interests.  With the state of the pleadings, the plaintiff-company moved the High Court to strike out the irrelevant paragraphs and give judgment, as no contest had been joined. The matter came before Adadevoh J. on \[p.658\] 4 March 1985. The learned judge rejected the application relying principally on a previous ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) in a different suit. Pausing for a moment, Ampiah J. (as he then was) found as a fact that the defendant had set up a rival company whose objects were in competition with the plaintiffs'. Ampiah J. (as he then was) however found nothing wrong with this; but the Court of Appeal to which the matter later reached, was very scathing in its condemnation. The ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) was accordingly set aside. It seems to me that whatever the merits of the ruling of Adadevoh J., that ruling collapsed alongside the superstructure that was the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was).  Adadevoh J. also held that there were triable issues, when clearly there were none. No judge is bound by the legal misapprehensions of another judge, let alone one of co-ordinate jurisdiction. Thus the rules of stare decisis do not extend to errors per incuriam even from the highest court of the land. In the leading case of Cudjoe v. Conta Ltd. \[1964\] G.L.R. 28 at 34, it was held that:  "". . . the company's assets are impressed with the qualities of a trust fund, . . . where the directors make a profit as the result of their fiduciary position, they have to account to the company for it.�  Clearly neither on the facts nor on the law had the defendant a title of a right to the company's assets. He had no defence at law to the claim for the return of the company's assets. In the circumstances for any court to rely on any technical reason to order what may amount to a retention in the defendant's hands of the company's property even for the briefest of moments would be perpetuating an inexcusable illegality.  On 17 March 1986, long after the vacation of the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was), the plaintiffs applied again to the High Court, presided over by Lutterodt J., for the offending paragraphs in the defence to be struck out and judgment entered for the plaintiffs.  It was in the consideration of this application that counsel for the defendant claimed an agreement had been struck with the plaintiffs to buy out the defendant and a counterclaim had been filed in the action. Counsel continued: ""otherwise I would agree that they are entitled to the reliefs they now seek."" Counsel did not challenge the court's jurisdiction; on the contrary he conceded it but raised supervening matters that prohibited a judgment being entered for the plaintiffs on the state of the pleadings.  The learned judge's appreciation of the position was summed up as follows:  \[p.659\]  ""My understanding of the plaintiffs' application is that since the defendant admits all the essential facts upon which their action is founded, and since more particularly his own counsel confesses that what they have filed in answer to the claim constitutes no defence at all, they are entitled to have these irrelevant, prejudicial embarrassing paragraphs 4-9 struck out. When these are thrown out, they urge, we shall find the defendant has no defence at all and they are thus entitled to judgment on admission.  In view of counsel's own confession therefore, once I have found that there is no agreement which binds the plaintiff-company and stops them from pursuing the claims set forth in the affidavit and as appears in the writ. I shall have no option but to strike out paragraphs 4-9 of the defence and enter judgment in the plaintiffs' favour.""  One can hardly quarrel with that. Clearly then the two obstacles to entering judgment for the plaintiffs were the existence of a prior agreement which would stay the plaintiffs' hand and the existence of a counterclaim. That was the position of all the parties and it speaks ill of any party resiling from that stand to dangle before this court the absurd red herring of a previous ruling. Taking the two matters in reverse order, it would be noted that the counterclaim was filed late and in breach of the High Court (Civil Procedure) (Amendment) (No 2) Rules, 1977 (LI 1129). This violation of the rules notwithstanding, a counterclaim being a separate action, the claim could proceed without being necessarily bogged down by an incompetent counterclaim.  On the second issue, there was nothing on record to show all agreement between the parties which should remove the matter from the court's jurisdiction. A ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) of 12 November 1985 placing an embargo on the disposal of the company's assets, never stated any agreement to buy out the defendant. Nor could any such agreement be legitimately inferred therefrom. The defendant neither pleaded nor exhibited it. The normal sanction for contempt is punishment till the contempt is purged. This salutary machinery was never invoked because no one contemplated violating the order. Moreover the shareholders of a company are not its agents for any purpose whatsoever: see Burnes v. Pernell (1849) 2 HLC 497. Consequently, any arrangement allegedly entered into between the defendant and another shareholder could not bind the company unless the company's consent is shown. In my view both issues: of an existing counterclaim and an alleged agreement, are mere red herring, as irritating as they are irrelevant. The defendant relied on those two \[p.660\] issues only and having failed in them, he is estopped from resurrecting any others.  Yet the mainstay of the defendant's argument is that there was a subsisting ruling of Adadevoh J. which had not been reversed on appeal; consequently, it was irregular for Lutterodt J. to entertain the application, let alone rule favourably on it. That stance fails to recognise that the ruling of the Court of Appeal completely demolished any force in the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then as) and equally denuded Adadevoh J.'s ruling of any weight. In any event, I must repeat, a new situation had arisen immediately the defendant conceded that his pleadings disclosed no answer to the plaint and that the matter should be resolved by other means. When these floundered the defendant's case collapsed. As was stated in Phipson on Evidence (10th ed.) at p 45:  ""Where admissions are made in an action, whether on the pleadings or otherwise, the other party may at any stage apply for such judgment or order as he may be entitled to on such admissions without waiting for the determination of any other question in the action.""  See also Lancashire Welders Ltd. v. Harland & Wolff Ltd. \[1950\] 2 All ER 1096, CA.  Since the case had not been stayed, the court had a duty to continue it to a conclusion even as also the plaintiffs to press their case. The intervening orders could not be other than interlocutory. The reductio ad absurdum of the argument that Lutterodt J. should not have proceeded with the matter in view of Adadevoh J.'s ruling, is to say that a court could stultify another court's proceedings permanently. No interim order can produce that effect.  I am of the clearest view that the appeal is completely devoid of merit and must be dismissed.  JUDGMENT OF ADJABENG J.A.  I also agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons contained in the learned judgments of my brothers Francois and Amua-Sekyi JJ.S.C. I have had the benefit of reading the judgments beforehand and I have nothing useful to add thereto.  JUDGMENT OF ADADE J.S.C.  The basic facts in this appeal have been sufficiently sketched in the opinions already read. All these being documentary (pleadings, motions, affidavits and rulings) cannot be in dispute.  The question that interests me and to which I desire to direct attention is whether in the circumstances of this case, Lutterodt J. was in order in assuming jurisdiction over the application that went to her and in deciding it.  \[p.661\]  The problem has arisen in very interesting circumstances. On 20 December 1984 the plaintiff-company (hereinafter called the plaintiffs) per their solicitor, Mr W. A. N. Adumua-Bossman, filed an application in the High Court asking for:  ""(i) an order striking out paragraphs 4-9 of the statement of defence herein on the ground that these paragraphs are all unnecessary or tending to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of this action; and  (ii) a consequential order for judgment upon the defendant's admission or alternatively in default of defence.""  This was two months after the statement of defence had been filed, but before the plaintiffs had taken any other step in the action. The supporting affidavit was sworn by ""George Kofi Asafu Adjaye of Dome, Accra, civil engineer and managing director of the plaintiff-company."" The application was naturally opposed. After hearing counsel for the parties (Adumua-Bossman for the plaintiffs, with Edwin Opoku and Ohene-Ampofo for the defendant) the High Court (Adadevoh J.) on 4 March 1985 gave its ruling, refusing the application on the ground that the defence raised triable issues which ought to be gone into. Whatever the merits of this ruling, it disposed of the application. After the ruling, therefore, the case was to take its normal course, i.e. the plaintiffs to file a reply to the statement of defence (if so advised); summons for directions to be taken; issues agreed; and a date fixed for hearing. This is the usual course a civil case takes. Of course, if either party felt aggrieved by the ruling, he had every right to appeal or to apply for a review. Neither party appealed, nor asked for a review.  On 4 October 1985 Mr. E. D. Kom filed notice that he had been appointed a solicitor for the defendant, in addition to Mr. K. Ohene-Ampofo. On 4 March 1986, exactly one year after Adadevoh J.'s ruling, Mr. Adumua-Bossman filed in the High Court another application in exactly the same terms and seeking the same remedies as the one which Adadevoh J. dismissed on 4 March 1985. The accompanying affidavit was the same as the earlier one, word for word, paragraph for paragraph, and was sworn by the same person, G. K. Asafu Adjaye. Somehow this new application was not heard until one whole year afterwards, when on 29 April 1987 it was put before a different judge, Lutterodt J. The plaintiff-applicants were again represented by Mr. Adumua-Bossman; but the defendant-respondent was this time represented by Mr. Kom. Lutterodt J. heard the application and in a reserved ruling read on 27 May 1987 granted it. She struck out the paragraphs of the statement of defence sought to be removed, and proceeded to give judgment for the plaintiffs on their \[p.662\] claim: final as regards claims 1 and 4; and interlocutory as regards claims 2 and 3 relating to damages and mesne profits. These orders were the exact opposite of what the same High Court (Adadevoh J.) had decreed on the same application two years earlier, on 4 March 1985. It is this ruling of Lutterodt J. which, passing through the Court of Appeal, is now before us for scrutiny.  The question which arises is whether having regard to the subsistence of the ruling of Adadevoh J. Lutterodt J. had jurisdiction to rehear that same application. In the course of attempting an answer to this question, it will be necessary to comment on: (a) the alleged agreement between counsel on or about 12 November 1985 concerning the buying-out of the defendant, together with the orders of Ampiah J. of the same date; and (b) the introduction into the debate of the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 25 July 1985 in Civil Appeal No 33/1985.  As stated earlier, the ruling of Lutterodt J. was appealed to the Court of Appeal. That court, by a majority of two to one (Lamptey J.A. dissenting) affirmed the ruling and dismissed the appeal. From their judgment this appeal has come.  For some reason, not easily appreciated, the issue of jurisdiction as formulated above, so glaring on the face of the record, managed to escape the attention of the majority in the Court of Appeal. It was completely side-stepped and never mentioned at all. The proceedings before Adadevoh J. receives a single short reference as follows:  ""The plaintiffs brought a motion that the defendant's paragraphs 4-9 be struck out as being no defence in law and judgment given them upon their claim.  The motion was not heard but was struck out by Adadevoh J. on 4 March 1985 on the grounds, inter alia, that the plaintiffs were unable to carry out the order of High Court made on 9 February 1982 (sic). Costs of �1,000 was awarded against the plaintiffs and the following order made:  'By Court: It is ordered that the senior High Court registrar should take the list of equipment in possession of the defendant. It is also ordered that the defendant, his agents, servants and privies should not sell or transfer the equipment to any third party until the final determination of this suit.' This order virtually put the defendant in possession and use of the machinery and the equipment claimed until the final determination of the suit by the High Court.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  With the greatest respect to their lordships, the motion was heard; it was not just struck out. Counsel on both sides addressed the court.  \[p.663\]  Notes of their submissions took almost a full page of the record. The ruling of Adadevoh J. covered slightly more than one page. Secondly, the final order of Adadevoh J. which the Court of Appeal chose to quote, conceals the substance of, and reasons for, the ruling. The substance of the ruling is as follows:  ""Having heard counsel for the plaintiff-applicants and having read the affidavit in support of the motion to strike out part of the defence and for judgment, and having heard counsel for the defendant-respondent and having read the affidavit in opposition, I am of the opinion that the defence filed by the defendant has raised certain triable issues which should be gone into.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  He then proceeded to discuss counsel's submissions, the paragraphs sought to be struck out, certain sections of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) and concluded: ""I am of the opinion that the averments made in paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 of the statement of defence raise some triable issues which must be gone into. . ."" (The emphasis is mine.)  The learned judge summarised the reasons for dismissing the motion as follows:  ""Since the plaintiffs are unable to carry out the orders of the High Court made on 9 February 1982 and \[for\] the reasons given in this ruling, the plaintiff-applicants' motion for judgment and to strike out paragraphs 4, 6 and 9 of the defendant's statement of defence is not granted as prayed for. Motion is dismissed. The plaintiffs should pay �1,000 costs to the defendant.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  Indeed, in paragraph 9 of his statement of defence the defendant denied that the machines belong to the plaintiffs. It was after the dismissal and the award of costs that the order for the preservation of the machinery, quoted by the Court of Appeal, was made.  The above references, which are only a small part of what Adadevoh J. wrote, are enough to show how much the Court of Appeal (majority) inadvertently concealed by that single reference, and how that single reference can be misleading. Adadevoh J.'s ruling was not seen by Lutterodt J. In this court Mr. Adumua-Bossman, for the plaintiffs, says that it escaped counsel on both sides to draw Lutterodt J.'s attention to the ruling. I find this strange. Mr. Kom (for the defendant) was, of course, relatively new to the case at the time. Even so, he surely must have had on his file the plaintiffs' supplementary affidavit filed on 2 October 1986 and in paragraph 2 of which reference was made to: ""the plaintiff-company's similar and unsuccessful \[p.664\] motion on 14 January 1985."" As regards Mr. Adumua-Bossman, his failure to call the learned judge's attention to the ruling in the ""similar and unsuccessful motion"" of 1985 is in my view, unfortunate. He had been in the case throughout; he moved the motion in 1985, and was present in court when Adadevoh J. read his ruling. When arguing the same motion before Lutterodt J., he could not possibly have forgotten the fate of the same application before Adadevoh J. particularly as, in argument before Lutterodt J., he referred to his supplementary affidavit.  It strikes me that if Lutterodt J. had seen the ruling of Adadevoh J., her reaction to the application then before her might well have been different. Be that as it may, the ruling in 1985 to the effect that the case be heard on the merits not having been set aside, and being an order of the High Court in the same case, Lutterodt J. in the same High Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to give a snap judgment without hearing the case on the merits. The impression must on no account be created that litigants and their lawyers can run from judge to judge until they get the ruling and orders they want. There can be no surer recipe for chaos and confusion in the courts. I would not subscribe to a precedent which points in that direction.  In this connection, I agree with the minority view of Lamptey J.A. in the Court of Appeal that:  ""There can be no doubt that the ruling of Adadevoh J. finally disposed of the application and the High Court, no matter how constituted, cannot and must not entertain an identical and similar application seeking the very reliefs which it had firmly and finally refused and dismissed. In my opinion the hearing and determination of the application now on appeal before us by Lutterodt J. was an exercise in futility; on the sole ground that the court lacked jurisdiction. On this ground I am of the opinion that the appeal be allowed. The decision of the lower court is a nullity and must be set aside. That the law in point is as I have stated above is supported by the case of Anane v. Efriyea (1940) 6 W.A.C.A. 169. At 170 the court stated as follows:  'This is not a question of estoppel by res judicata and not a question of giving in evidence a judgment in another case as res judicata. It is not a question of evidence at all. It is simply the blunt and inescapable truth that the Commissioner's Court having given an interlocutory judgment in a particular suit that judgment stands unless in so far as it may be reviewed by the particular Judge who pronounced it or altered by a competent Appeal Court. No other Judge of the Provincial Commissioner's Court can \[p.665\] come along and say�either ex proprio motu or, on application of one of the parties,�'I do not agree with the interlocutory judgment already pronounced by this Court and I shall ignore it and compel the parties to litigate the same question afresh. ""'  The court went further to state at 171 that:  ""The Defendant's remedies, if dissatisfied with the judgment of Dickinson, Acting Assistant Chief Commissioner, were either to appeal as against an interlocutory judgment within the time provided ad hoc or to raise the matter on appeal after final judgment.""  The present case is on all fours with Anane v. Efriyea (supra).  In fairness to Lutterodt J., it must be observed that in coming to a decision on the motion, the learned judge had very little assistance from the Bar, which is a pity. The defence, in spite of all the time at their disposal (a full twelve months), did not file an affidavit in opposition to the application. The motion was filed on 4 March 1986; the plaintiffs' supplementary affidavit was filed on 2 October 1986; the motion was moved on 29 April 1987. An affidavit in opposition could have raised not only Adadevoh J.'s ruling, but also the alleged agreement between counsel which was orally pleaded at the hearing, as well as the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) of 12 November 1985 (of which more anon).  Secondly, Lutterodt J. was obviously misled by defence counsel's ""confession"" (I believe she meant ""concession""). But that ""concession"" was predicated on two grounds: the agreement between counsel and the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) of 12 November 1985. The record shows that after counsel had referred to the agreement to buy out his client, Mr. Kom proceeded:  ""The result is the order of 12 November 1985. Agyeman-Bempah was present. Both parties have paid an amount and this \[presumably the valuation\] is being done. We filed an interlocutory. In view of these order\[s\] made for valuation and in view of the fact that the company has seen to it that the other (sic) be completed they cannot ask for these reliefs.""  Counsel then concludes: ""Otherwise I would agree that they are entitled to the reliefs they now seek."" (The emphasis is mine.) The �concession� therefore was a qualified concession. It cannot be used without inquiring into the conditions upon which it was given. Otherwise it ceases to have any force. The learned judge said she found no record of the agreement, and so discounted it. However, she \[p.666\] did find a full record of the ruling of Ampiah J. (as he then was) which she quoted in extenso, but she failed, respectfully, to consider the effect of that ruling on the proceedings before her: there is no indication in the ruling that such effect was considered. In my view, that failure vitiated the so-called �concession� on which she so heavily relied.  The question, however, is: was there, indeed, in all probability, an agreement between counsel binding on their clients, as orally pleaded by Mr. Kom? The issue impinges on professional ethics and must not be glossed over by this court, especially as it was found to be relevant and crucial in the two courts below, and it remains relevant and crucial to a fair and just decision in this appeal.  I must premise that in the administration of justice, the courts must be able to accept and rely on statements form counsel at the Bar, in particular, statements concerning agreements, compositions, arrangements, accords, etc. in respect cases in which they are engaged. On a number of occasions, these agreements, etc. will, at the instance of one or both counsel, be recorded in the record book. But very often these agreements, etc. are not recorded, if only because they may not be spoken to the hearing of the judge. It is the outcome of the exchanges which often gets recorded. For example, a harmless record such as ""by consent case adjourned for three months"" may be hiding a substantial unspoken agreement between counsel that one side has conceded the claims and has asked for time to look for money to pay the other side, so that on the return date counsel are merely going to announce that the case has been settled, and apply for it to be struck out as discontinued. In such a situation, if something should happen, e.g. if the defence should apply to dismiss the action for want of prosecution, the judge will look in vain in the record book for the substantive agreement. But these off-record agreements enormously assist the work of the courts; they are agreements, etc. made between honourable men of an honourable profession, and they are always expected to be honourably kept.  If ever there should be a dispute in open court as to what was agreed or not agreed between counsel, off-record, the court should investigate the matter if it is relevant to its decision. In this case, from the nature of the ruling given by Lutterodt J., it is evident that the alleged agreement was material and relevant to her decision. Mr. Kom had alleged orally that there had been an agreement of a certain nature between himself and Mr. Agyeman-Bempah (then representing the plaintiff) on a certain occasion, and that on the basis of that agreement counsel had consented to a certain order being made Mr. Adumua-Bossman denied this agreement. The learned judge, Lutterodt J. adjourned her ruling for a month to enable her check on this. She \[p.667\] combed the record book, found no record of the alleged agreement, and then proceeded to deliver her ruling.  I cannot say that I am happy with this aspect of the proceedings. I do not see why, when Mr. Adumua-Bossman found himself unable to agree with Mr Kom, an adjournment was not sought to consult Mr. Agyeman-Bempah on the issue. After all, he represented the plaintiff-company at the material time. Alternatively, when the record book failed to turn up any evidence of the alleged agreement, Mr. Agyeman-Bempah could have been invited to make a statement on the issue, either from the Bar or in writing. This would have settled the matter. None of this happened, a state of affairs which would seem, in the circumstances, to have significantly affected the level of justice or injustice done in this case. It seems to me that from the record there was, in all probability, such an agreement, binding on the plaintiffs, and therefore disabling them, as contended by Mr. Kom, from pursuing their application for judgment.  Mr. Adumua-Bossman says that if there was any agreement at all, it was one between the majority shareholders and the defendant, not between the plaintiff-company and the defendant, and therefore the plaintiff-company could not be bound by such an agreement. This argument cannot be right. It must be appreciated that at the material time, Mr. Agyeman-Bempah was representing the plaintiff-company, not any shareholder. Therefore any agreement or concessions he made must have been made on behalf of his client. He could not bind persons who had not instructed him, who were not his clients, and who were not parties to the case anyway. But this argument, misconceived though it was, found favour with the High Court. Said the learned judge:  "". . . I find no record of the fact that it was agreed that the majority shareholders buy the minority shareholders. In any case, I would agree with the applicants' counsel's submission that the shareholders in particular are a distinct personality from the plaintiff-company. Since no judgment by consent has been entered against the plaintiff-company (as the agreement reached in any settlement) I would find it difficult to hold that they are bound by any such orders.""  The record shows that on 14 October 1985, Mr. Kom for the defendant, filed an application for interim injunction to restrain the plaintiff-company from ""disposing or otherwise alienating any of the assets of the company until the final hearing and determination of the suit."" In the affidavit in support of the application the defendant charged that:  \[p.668\]  ""4 . . . my co-director-shareholders, the defendants herein to the counterclaim, have formed a plant-hire company called Asakum Plant Hire Ltd. and I fear that if the application is not made and granted, the machines, the subject of this suit and the other assets of the company may find their way there.  5\. That any sale of the company's assets during the pendency of the suit may frustrate my counterclaim.""  The company did not file any affidavit in opposition. When the application was called before Ampiah J. on 12 November. 1985, the record reads:  ""Agyeman-Bempah for the plaintiff-respondent, E. D. Kom for the defendant-applicant�Motion for interim injunction. Mr. Agyeman-Bempah: We have agreed that a firm of accountants be appointed to value the assets and liabilities of the company and value the shares. They are to prepare a statement of accounts on the plaintiff-company.  Mr. Kom: That is correct.""  Following from this, the court made the order appointing the accountants. Thus the application for interim injunction was not argued at all, and from the nature of the statement by Mr. Agyeman-Bempah, it is clear that some other discussions and accords must have preceded the result which was announced in open court by Mr. Agyeman-Bempah. The valuation could only have been for the purposes of enabling the parties to know how much each of the persons involved in the company was entitled to. Mr. Kom says that the company was to pay off or buy out the defendant. This does not appear in Mr. Agyeman-Bempah's statement, or in the order finally made by Ampiah J. (as he then was) but the alleged agreement fits squarely the purpose of the valuation as indicated by Mr. Kom.  Further, in a letter dated 21 March 1986 addressed by Mr. Adumua-Bossman to Mr. Kom, there appears a passage which lends support to the position taken by Mr. Kom. In that letter, Mr. Adumua-Bossman says:  ""Re Asakum Engineering & Construction Ltd.  Following upon our short discussion in court 2 yesterday morning, I met the directors of Asakum Engineering and Construction Ltd. (save except your client) in the afternoon. I believe I summarise their company's position, accurately as follows:  \[p.669\]  (1) The other shareholders (whether directors or not) and the company itself are willing in principle to buy out your client (Maxwell Kwasi Agyeman-Agyekum) at a valuation to be made by the accounting firm of Delloite & Co., Accra . . .�  (The emphasis is mine.)  Delloite & Co. was the company appointed on 12 November 1985 by the court (Ampiah J. (as he then was)) to prepare the accounts of the company and to value the shares."" It would seem to me that the plaintiff-company's position had all along been at stated by Mr. Adumua-Bossman, and that it was on the same understanding that Mr. Agyeman-Bempah made the statement on 12 November 1985. It must have been realised on all sides that relations among the directors and shareholders had soured beyond repair, and the only sensible thing to do was to buy out the defendant, so that the group of family members left could become the sole shareholders. I find that on the record the agreement spoken of by Mr. Kom, in all probability, was entered into by the company and bound the company. Contrary to what the Court of Appeal (majority) says, a company may in certain circumstances be ordered by the court to purchase its own shares \[see section 218 (2) (c) of Act 179\]. So that an agreement that the plaintiff-company buy out the defendant cannot be unlawful. In any case, as the Court of Appeal observed on 30 July 1987 in an application for a stay of execution (per Amua-Sekyi J.A. (as he then was)):  �. . . the consent order \[of 12 November 1985\] was made in a suit to which the company was a party and in the presence of their counsel. They are bound to comply with it. . .""  The letter by Mr. Adumua-Bossman which I have referred to was written on 21 March 1986, and the reply to it, expressing complete agreement with the sentiments contained therein, was dated 10 April 1986. Both documents were in the possession of counsel when Lutterodt J. was dealing with the plaintiffs' motion on 29 April 1987. How, notwithstanding the accords in November 1985 before Ampiah J. (as he then was), counsel could also have glossed over the agreement evidenced in writing in the correspondence of 1986 when they were arguing the motion before Lutterodt J. in April 1987, is a mystery.  Commenting on the alleged agreement between counsel, the Court of Appeal (per Wuaku J.S.C.) observed:  ""I have gone through the record of proceedings and I am entirely in agreement with the trial judge that there is no evidence of any \[p.670\] agreement oral or written between Mr. Kom and Mr. Agyeman-Bempah. If there was one, it was never pleaded. There was no defence to the plaintiffs' claim.""  This statement shows how crucial the agreement was to the case. But the statement is unfortunate. Mr. Kom never said that the agreement was in existence at or near the commencement of the action. So that pleading the agreement is totally out of the question. A proper reading of the record indicates that the agreement was entered into just when the motion for interim injunction was about to be taken, i.e. on 12 November 1985. In any case, at the Court of Appeal stage when the learned judge said he went through the record, there existed an agreement, evidenced in writing, of the same nature and character as the one spoken of by Mr. Kom, not so much between Mr. Kom and Mr. Agyeman-Bempah, but between Mr. Kom and Mr. Adumua-Bossman, representing the same parties as before. All the letters evidencing this agreement were in existence at the time Lutterodt J. was hearing the motion. They were not put before her; but they were on the record, and were before the Court of Appeal. It would seem that the Court of Appeal, respectfully, failed to adequately examine the evidence on record in this regard.  Be that as it may, the hearing before Ampiah J. (as he then was) terminated in a consent order as follows:  ""By court: By consent Messrs Delloite, Haskins and Sells, Chartered Accountants are appointed to prepare the accounts of the company and to value the shares. They are to submit their report on or by 11 February 1986. The parties should make available to the firm all the available books to the accountants. The accountants will be paid their remuneration as agreed upon. Registrar to act accordingly. In the interim no one is to dispose of any of the properties of the company pending the report.""  The Court of Appeal's assessment of this order is that it was a mere interlocutory ruling or order:  ""it \[could\] not therefore operate to stop the case from being heard to its conclusion: it would only remain in force until the final determination of the suit when its force would be spent . . .�  I respectfully beg to differ. The order for accounts and for a valuation of the shares had the effect of putting a brake on the further progress of the case, until the accounts and valuation were ready. Notice that the order was by consent of both parties; it was announced \[p.671\] by the plaintiffs, and agreed to by the defence, implying that the parties appreciated that the accounts and valuation were necessary for a final determination of the suit. The hearing of the case therefore could not go on without the accounts and valuation. I think the Court of Appeal (majority), put a wrong interpretation on the order.  Mr. Adumua-Bossman argues that the ruling of Adadevoh J. (and by extension that of Ampiah J. (as he then was) too) was not binding on Lutterodt J. because they were all judges of co-ordinate jurisdiction: the ruling or orders of one High Court judge cannot bind another High Court judge. He cites a number of cases in purported support of this proposition. A study of the cases reveals that the statement is correct only in the context that the decision of a judge in one case does not bind another judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction in another case. Thus in Re Seymour: Ex parte Trustee \[1937\] 3 All ER 499, Clauson J. disagreed with Vaughan-William J's interpretation of section 49 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914 in Re Badham; Ex parte Trustee (1893) 10 Morr. 252 and refused to apply it.  In 1957 Willer J. had decided in The Telemachus \[1957\] 1 All ER 72 that payments to salvors should take account of the tax likely to be paid by the salvors on the award. This should be added to the estimated entitlement so that the award is, as it were, free of tax. A year later, Pilcher J. sitting in Island Tug & Barge Ltd. v. S.S. Makedonia \[1958\] 1 All ER 236 refused to follow that ruling. He decided that the salvors should get no more than what they are entitled to, no allowance being made for tax. The salvors should compute their accounts and pay tax on their profits in the usual way. Said the learned judge at 244:  ""I need not say that it is only after the most anxious thought and careful consideration that I have felt compelled to disagree with the views on this topic expressed by Willmer J. in the Telemachus. I do not feel, as he did, that any principle laid down in British Transport Commission v. Gourley \[1955\] 3 All ER 796, compels, or even inclines, me to take the view that a salvor who is already generously rewarded on well-known principles should have his award further increased so as to indemnify him wholly or in part for the fact that the fiscal law to which he is subject requires him to pay tax on the profit element in his salvage award.""  In Re Burton's Settlement \[1955\] Ch. 82, again a judge declined to apply an earlier decision of his brother judge in another case. There are countless examples of such situations. I do not find them helpful \[p.672\] here. In all these cases a judge chooses to chart a course for himself, in conflict with an earlier case, leaving it to the appellate tribunal to settle the conflict.  I must concede, however, that it has been known for rulings in interim injunctions to be changed in the course of the same case, when the change is warranted by changed circumstances or on the occurrence of new matters. For example, a refusal to grant an application at one stage may, on a repeat application specifying changed circumstances or new matters, especially as to balance of hardship, be reversed and the application granted. So also may an earlier grant be revoked.  But neither the situation in the Seymour line of cases nor in the interim injunction cases, applies in this case. Adadevoh J. had ruled, dismissing an application for a quick judgment, that the suit be heard, on the merit. This ruling was not reviewed or appealed against. Later for the purposes of hearing the case, the parties agreed before Ampiah J. (as he then was) that the accounts of the company should be struck and the shares valued. All these rulings being on file, in particular the latter, it could not be right that Lutterodt J. should disregard them and proceed to give a snap judgment.  Six months before Lutterodt J. sat on the motion, the plaintiffs had filed a supplementary affidavit to which was attached a judgment of the Court of Appeal in another case begun in 1983 wherein Agyekum, the defendant-appellant herein, was the plaintiff and the company, along with three directors and shareholders, were the defendants. The judgment was dated 25 July 1985. The company pleaded in the supplementary affidavit that the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the order of that court were both ""relevant matters to be taken into consideration in the \[motion for judgment\] filed by the plaintiff-company."" No doubt the company sought to use the judgment as a new material introducing changed circumstances, and therefore justifying the rehearing of the application by Lutterodt J. I need only to observe that Lutterodt J. did not see it that way. Indeed, the judgment played no part whatever in her declarations. Although her attention was called to the supplementary affidavit, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was nowhere mentioned, let alone considered in her reserved ruling, implying that as far as she was concerned, the decision of the Court of Appeal had nothing to do with any changed circumstances. Her assumption of jurisdiction cannot therefore be justified by recourse to changed circumstances or new matters.  It would seem that the existence of Ladco Ltd., a company allegedly formed by the defendant and others, prejudiced the decision against the defendant. It is bad enough that the defendant, a director-shareholder of the plaintiff-company, should have formed a company \[p.673\] in competition with the plaintiffs. Somehow no one seems to find it equally bad and reprehensible that the other director-shareholders should also have formed a rival company, Asakum Plant Hire Ltd., for the purposes of which they were using property, especially plant and machinery, belonging to the plaintiff-company.  It has been said that those who come to equity must come with clean hands. It happens that in this case, the courts below shut their eyes to the realities of the situation, and sought escape in the legal fiction that a company is different from its members or directors, when it is patent that such an abstruse argument is bound to result in gross injustice.  When courts talk of the separate personality of a company, distinct from the shareholders and directors, relying, particularly on Salomon v. Salomon & Co Ltd. \[1897\] AC 22, PC attention is hardly called to the fact that several exceptions have been created by the courts, wherein the veil is lifted, i.e. ""the law disregards the corporate entity and pays regard instead to the economic realities behind the legal facade."": see Gower, Modern Company Law (3 rd. ed.) (1969) at p. 189. The learned author says at p. 216 that the law will crack open the corporate shell ""if corporate personality is being blatantly used as a cloak for fraud or improper conduct.""  In this appeal, given the charges and counter-charges of improper conduct on the part of the directors, I wonder whether any court of justice should maintain the cloak, especially where, as in this case, the veil is not for the protection of members of the company against third parties, but in respect of the interests of the members and directors of the company inter se. In such a case it will be unjust to allow one party (to plagiarise a phrase by Russell J.) to hold the mask of corporate entity ""before his face in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equity."" (See Jones v. Lipman \[1962\] W.L.R. 832 at 836.)  There is no doubt that looking at the record, the real plaintiffs are the other directors and shareholders led by G. K. Asafu-Adjaye. These are the persons referred to by the defendant as the company's alter ego. There is evidence that the company has ceased to operate since 2 October 1984; it therefore exists only in name. Relations among the directors and shareholders have strained to such a limit that the parties can no longer come together to do business. They have pulled apart, breaking up into two groups: one group with the defendant, has formed Ladco Ltd; the other group, with G. K. Asafu-Adjaye, has formed Asakum Plant Hire Ltd. Each group is keeping for its use the plaintiff-company's property (particularly plant and machinery) which it had in its possession at the commencement of the diaspora. There are allegations that some directors have misappropriated funds of the company to put up private houses; that another has diverted cement, \[p.674\] and so on. These are mere allegations, and naturally have been denied. The defendant is described in the statement of claim as ""a civil engineer, a shareholder and general manager"" of the company. The defendant himself says he is a director-general manager, and owns a third of the shares of the company. And according to the plaintiffs' counsel, the defendant is sued as a director. Notwithstanding these statements by and on behalf of the plaintiffs, counsel is able to assert in the letter of 21 March 1986 that the defendant:  �was never allotted any shares, and he never paid for any, so that strictly speaking, he has no shares to be bought in the proposed buying-out process; certainly none to be valued.""  This no doubt explains the plaintiffs' attitude to the order for accounts which they themselves agreed to before Ampiah J. (as he then was). In an application for a stay of execution, the Court of Appeal, Amua-Sekyi J.A. (as he then was) felt, without expressing an opinion on the matter, that:  ""the fact that the company have refused to permit the valuation \[of the company's assets\] to be made may at the hearing of the appeal be held to disentitle them to relief, and the learned judge \[Lutterodt J.\] be held to have erred in entertaining the application for judgment.""  With these sentiments, I am in complete agreement. It would seem that someone is trying to cheat, and the court should not encourage cheating. Someone is trying to use the myth of the separate personality of a company to get into his hands and under his control all the assets of the company to the detriment of the defendant who too is a shareholder, director and general manager.  This case once more illustrates how dangerous and unsatisfactory it can be to give judgments on pleadings alone, except in cases where an admission of liability is clear and unequivocal: see, e.g. Pomaa v. Fosuhene \[1987-88\] 1 G.L.R. 244, SC. As far as practicable, cases ought to be decided on oral and sworn evidence from the witness-box, tested by cross-examination, if the truth is to be properly ascertained. In this case, it is apparent that a lot is being conveniently pushed under the carpet, in an effort to arrive at certain ends by the short route�a sad state of affairs indeed.  The decision of the Court of Appeal has the effect of putting all the plants and machinery of the company into the hands of one set of directors, to the detriment of the other set. The one redeeming feature of that decision (majority) is the court's ruling that the defendant's counterclaim is voidable, not void. It would seem therefore, that not having been avoided, the counterclaim is still in the High Court, to be \[p.675\] tried and determined. In those circumstances, the justice of the case requires that the order of Ampiah J. (as he then was) of 12 November 1985 be enforced and that meanwhile all the plant and machinery of the company be given into the custody of a third party, say Plant Pool Ltd., so that neither party is given any undeserved advantage over the other.  In the result, I agree with counsel for the defendant-appellant that:  (i) given the ruling of Adadevoh J. on 4 March 1985 and of Ampiah J. (as he then was) on 12 November 1985, Lutterodt J. had no jurisdiction to hear the motion again and deliver the ruling of 27 May 1987; and  (ii) that there was indeed an agreement on or before 12 November 1985 solemnly and professionally entered into between the parties represented by their counsel; that agreement bound the plaintiff-company. The learned judge erred when she held the contrary, and proceeded to give them judgment, thus enabling them to profit from their own misconduct in jettisoning that agreement.  I would allow the appeal and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal, as well as that of the High Court.  JUDGMENT OF AIKINS J.S.C.  I have had the opportunity of reading beforehand the judgment just read by my brother Adade J.S.C. and I entirely agree with the reasons and conclusions.  However, I would wish to add a few words. It is my view that since the ruling or order or both of Adadevoh J. on 4 March 1985 had not been set aside on appeal or otherwise, Lutterodt J. lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the fresh identical application filed on 4 March 1986 seeking the very reliefs which had been refused and dismissed. Be that as it may, as Lutterodt J. had searched and found the order made by Ampiah J. (as he then was) the a firm of chartered accountants should go into the accounts of the company and value the shares and report by 11 February 1986, it is strange for her to hold that the parties are not bound by any such order.  The order of Ampiah J. (as he then was) was made as a result of his acceptance of the agreement reached by counsel for both parties, i.e. Mr. Agyeman-Bempah and Mr. Kom, that a firm of accountants be appointed to value the assets and liabilities of the company and value its shares. In spite of this Lutterodt J. held: ""I have found that there is no agreement which binds the plaintiff-company and stops them from pressing their claims . . ."" Furthermore, when Lutterodt J. was delivering her ruling on 17 July 1987, refusing the stay of execution sought by the defendant she made the following order:  \[p.676\]  ""But for the avoidance of doubt the order of Ampiah J. (as he then was), namely that no party disposes of the company's property until the final disposition of the suit, still stands and is binding on the parties including the plaintiff-company acting through whomsoever.""  How then can one part of an order bind the party but the other part held not to be binding?  In my judgment the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in confirming the decision of Lutterodt J. In its majority judgment the Court of Appeal observed that:  ""The defendant claims to be a director in the plaintiff-company and yet he has formed Ladco Ltd. in competition with the plaintiffs, this is in direct conflict with his interest as a director in the plaintiff-company, he must not be allowed by it.""  In making this observation the court conveniently lost sight of the fact that the co-director, G. K. Asafu-Adjaye, and the other shareholders had also formed another company of their own called Asakum Plant Hire Ltd. which is using the machines of the plaintiff-company in their custody.  I think in view of the several serious allegations and counter-allegations made by both directors of malpractices and misappropriation of the company's funds, and the orders of the High Court in respect of this case which have not been carried out, justice cannot be seen to be done if this appeal is dismissed. An agreement had been reached that a firm of chartered accountants should be appointed to value the assets and liabilities of the plaintiff-company, and evaluate the shares with a view to the defendant-appellant being paid off. After a consent order had been made by the court, the company had blatantly refused to surrender the company's books and co-operate with the accountants, with the result that the said accountants had made their exit from the work entrusted to them. There is no doubt in my mind that a valuation report would assist the court in making any assessment deemed necessary.  In my judgment if litigants are to benefit from their actions the orders of our courts must be respected and obeyed, but should not be flouted with impunity.  It is for these other reasons that I would also allow the appeal.  DECISION  Appeal dismissed.  L. K.

"Practice and procedure�Admissible evidence�Right to call�Application by plaintiff to call evidence�Effect of wrongful rejection of application by trial court�Failure to request trial court to record refusal of calling fresh evidence�Effect.  HEADNOTES  The plaintiff was arrested and detained by the police on information given by the defendant. He was kept in custody for a week before being put before court, charged \[p.198\] with threat of death of the defendant. At the trial the defendant have evidence for the prosecution but the plaintiff was acquitted and discharged. The plaintiff then sued the defendant at the District Court Grade 1, Tamale claiming damages for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The plaintiff�s unchallenged evidence at the trial was that it was the defendant who procured his arrest and detention, in that the defendant led the police to his house and in his absence left instructions for him to report himself. Later whilst in custody, the defendant pointed him out to a policeman who assaulted him even before he was told of the offence he had committed. Counsel for the defendant submitted that the defendant had performed his civic duty by reporting a crime to the police and that the plaintiff not being entitled to judgment should, be non-suited under the Courts Ordinance, Cap. 4 (1951 Rev.), Sched. 1, Order 40, rr.1-3. The magistrate accepted the submission, non-suited the plaintiff and awarded costs against him. In the instant appeal against the decision of the trial magistrate, the High Court having around that there was nothing on the record of appeal indicating that the plaintiff intended calling additional evidence.  Held, allowing the appeal:  (1) under the Courts Ordinance, Cap. 4 (1951 Rev.), Sched. 1, Order 40 rr.1-3, the trial court might, in its discretion, non-suit a plaintiff: (a) when he had closed his case. Where at the close of the evidence, the defendant was not found to be the person liable to the plaintiffs claim, the plaintiff should not be non-suited but judgment should be entered for the defendant so as to avoid the situation whereby the plaintiff was left free to harass the defendant with another suit on the same cause of action; (b) the plaintiff had not discharged the burden of producing sufficient evidence and he was unable to make out his case, judgment should be entered for the defendant and not merely should the plaintiff be non-suited; (c) the court might direct that notwithstanding the non-suit, the plaintiff should be at liberty to set aside any judgment of non-suit in any case of surprise, mistake or accident; and (d) the court might non-suit the plaintiff without any application by the defendant and even after judgment on a motion for retrial or review. Since in the instant case the plaintiff�s evidence had raised a prima facie case of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, the order non-suiting the plaintiff was wrong and it would be set aside. Ryder v. Wombwell (1868) L.R. 4 Exch. 32 and Eduful v. Pantsil \[1966\] G.L.R. 27 at 30, S.C. cited.  Per curiam. The relevance and usefulness of this practice of non-suit has been questioned even in England which ... abolished the practice in the High Court in 1883 ... Order 40 of Cap.4 remains good law in practice in the district courts notwithstanding my personal opinion that it should be reviewed since a magistrate who is so minded, can use it to let an unsuccessful plaintiff harass a defendant with another suit in respect of the same cause of action.  (2) The plaintiff was entitled to call such evidence as would help him establish his claim. And if such admissible evidence had been rejected by the trial court and substantial injustice occasioned thereby, the injured party was entitled to a new trial. Provided he formally tendered such evidence at the trial and requested the court to make a note of it or, if the request was refused, to enter an exception upon the record. Otherwise it would not be open to the affected party to challenge the trial court's record on appeal. In the instant case, at the end of the plaintiff�s evidence there was nothing on record to show that his counsel intimated calling additional evidence nor did he mention in his address that he had not closed his case. In the event, the plaintiff was never denied a right of being heard. Gibbs v. Pike (1842) 9 M & W 351; Whitehouse v. Hemmant (1858) 27 L.J.Ex. 295; Campbell v. Loader (1865) 27 L.J.Ex. 58; Penn v.

The facts are set out in the judgment.  COUNSEL  R. C. A. Azumah for the appellant.  S. B. Dy-Yakah for the respondent.  JUDGMENT OF BENIN J.  The plaintiff-appellant herein issued out a writ of summons at the District Court Grade 1, Tamale. By the particulars of claim, the appellant claimed against the defendant-respondent damages for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The court did not order the parties to file any pleadings so the case proceeded to trial summarily under Order 25, r.1 of the Courts Ordinance, Cap.4 (1951 Rev.). On \[p.200\] the hearing date the plaintiff gave evidence on the events leading to his arrest by the police, his subsequent detention and assault on him by the police and finally his being unsuccessfully prosecuted at the District Court Grade II, Tamale. He was cross-examined by counsel for the respondent who made a submission under Order 40 of Cap. 4, which was replied to by counsel for the appellant. The learned trial magistrate there and then accepted the submission and non-suited the appellant and awarded �1,000 costs against him.  At the trial the appellant had testified that his arrest was caused by the respondent. That when the respondent and the policeman came to look for him the first time in order to arrest him, they met him absent and they left a message for him to report to the police at a stated time. He did report himself to the police who locked him up for some time. Thereafter the respondent in the company of one named police corporal came to the station and identified him. The police corporal who had come with the respondent started assaulting him (the appellant) and it was then he mentioned the reason why he (the appellant) had been arrested; and the reason being that he the appellant had been hired by a Dagarti man to kill the respondent. The appellant was locked up in police cell and later in prison custody for a week or so before he was put before court. The respondent testified for the prosecution in that case in which the appellant was charged with threat of death, but he was acquitted and discharged. And according to the appellant, this prosecution has led to his business partners ceasing to do any business with him. He also suffered damage to his reputation before his in-laws. That was the plaintiff�s evidence-in-chief. I shall quote the entire cross-examination at this stage:  ""Q. From what you stated it was you who surrendered yourself to the police.  A. That is so.  Q. The defendant gave evidence as witness only for the State (the Republic).  A. That is so.  Q. You know that the defendant has no power over the police?  A. That is so.""  Then followed the submission that the appellant had led no satisfactory evidence to entitle him to any judgment in the sense that the respondent only made a report to the police who then took their own steps to prosecute the appellant. The respondent only performed his civic duty by reporting a crime to the police. His counsel submitted \[p.201\] and I quote: "" Where witnesses are called this case will not be made better for the plaintiff; he therefore is not entitled to judgment and he should be non-suited under Order 40 of Cap. 4.""  Counsel for the appellant replied that the plaintiff had led satisfactory evidence in that the police acted only at the instigation of the respondent and hence there was a cause of action.  This whole appeal has turned up on what interpretation to put on Order 40 of Cap. 4 which has the following as its provision:  ""Non-suit  1\. The Court may in any suit, without the consent of parties non-suit the plaintiff; where satisfactory evidence shall not be given entitling either the plaintiff or the defendant to judgment of the Court.  2\. The Court may upon motion for new trial or review of judgment, order a non-suit or judgment to be entered, although no leave has been reserved at the trial.  3\. Any judgment of non-suit, unless the Court or Judge otherwise directs, shall have the same effect as judgment on the merits for the defendant but in any case of mistake, surprise, or accident, any judgment of non-suit may be set aside on such terms as to payment of costs and otherwise as to the Court or judge may seem just.""  There is a dearth of authority on this practice of non-suit probably because it does not exist in the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), or more probably because it is not often invoked. Defendants have often relied on a submission of no case in civil trials rather than invoking Order 40 of Cap. 4. Probably too, it is because the district courts and legal practitioners do not actually appreciate the scope of the practice. Before 1875 the advantage of this practice which was peculiar to common law courts was that the plaintiff could, on paying all costs, bring another action against the defendant for the same cause of action. However under Order 41, r.6 of the R.S.C. 1875, any judgment of non-suit, unless the court otherwise directed, had the same effect as a judgment on the merits, that is it barred the plaintiff from bringing another action for the same cause Order 41, rule 6 of R.S.C. 1875 which is similar to Order 40, r.3 of Cap. 4, was abolished in 1883 and there is thus no such thing as a non-suit in the High Court of England. In fact the relevance and usefulness of this practice of non-suit have been questioned even in England which as I have said abolished that practice in the High Court in 1883, over a century ago. Hence Wilmer L.J. lamented over its continued existence \[p.202\] in the English county court in the case of Clack v. Arthur Engineering Ltd. \[1959\] 2 All E.R. 503 at 511, C.A. where he said:  �We cannot leave this case ... without venturing to offer the suggestion that consideration might well be given to the desirability of abolishing the power to non-suit in the county court, as it has been abolished in the High Court. Non-suit was a remedy suitable enough in an age when the plaintiff won or lost his case according to the way in which it was pleaded, and when no right of amendment existed such as exists today. Bearing in mind the right of discontinuance which is conferred by C.C.R, Order 18, and the abundant facilities for amendment provided under C.C.R, Order 15 we find it difficult to appreciate what object is served by preserving in the county court today the old common law remedy of non-suit which we venture to think few practitioners of today fully understand.""  Like the prophet Jeremiah lamenting over the woes of Israel which still did not reform, Wilmer L.J�s lamentation for the abolishment of non-suit practice has fallen on deaf ears and in Ghana it still remains in our statute books. And the fact that it is not used does not mean it does not exist. There is no rule in Ghana or in England, as there is in Scotland (see Craies, Statute Law (5th ed.) at 4), that a statute or law is impliedly repealed by age, non-user or desuetude. In H.R.H. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover v. Attorney-General \[1955\] 3 W.L.R. 868 at 879, C.A. the Attorney-General expressly disclaimed any reliance on the argument that the statute (1705) 4 Anne, c.4 was a ""dead letter."" Thus Order 40 of Cap. 4 remains good law in practice in the district courts notwithstanding my personal opinion that it should be reviewed since a magistrate who is so minded, can use it to let an unsuccessful plaintiff harass a defendant with another suit in respect of the same cause of action. This latter practice was frowned upon by the Supreme Court in the case of Eduful v. Pantsil \[1966\] G.L.R. 27 at 30, S.C.  Now let me examine the scope and extent of Order 40, rr.1-3 of Cap. 4. From Order 40, r.1 the trial court may non-suit a plaintiff when at the close of the evidence there is no satisfactory evidence led entitling the plaintiff or the defendant to the judgment of the court. This is a discretionary power and must thus be exercised judicially. By rule 3, the court has a discretion to direct judgment to be entered for the defendant, but it should non-suit the plaintiff when there is no evidence to support the plaintiff�s case: see Ryder v. Wombwell \[1868\] L.R. 4 Exch. 32. The court may hold that there is for this purpose no \[p.203\] evidence when there is no substantial evidence, a mere scintilla of evidence not being sufficient to preclude a non-suit. Whether the evidence which the plaintiff gives can be considered any evidence at all of a cause of action is a question of law for the court. It was held in Westgate v. Crowe \[1908\] 1 K.B. 24 that where from the plaintiff's evidence it appears that the defendant is not the person liable, the latter is entitled to judgment and the court should not enter a non-suit.  From the foregoing and under Order 40 the practice of non-suit may be summed up as follows:  (i) the court may only consider a non-suit when the plaintiff has closed his case. By Order 36, rr. 2 and 3 of Cap 4 he closes his case after he has testified (if need be) and called his witnesses (if any). Thus not until the plaintiff has announced to the court that he has closed his case, the question of a non-suit does not arise;  (ii) the court may only consider a non-suit if the plaintiff has not discharged the burden of producing sufficient evidence to support his cause of action. Order 40, r.1: see Ryder v. Wombwell (supra). Ordinary rules of evidence will apply here;  (iii) where at the close of the evidence the defendant is not found to be the person liable to the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff should not be non-suited but judgment should be entered for the defendant. This is to avoid the situation whereby the plaintiff is left free to harass the defendant with another suit on the same cause of action: see Westgate v. Crowe (supra);  (iv) where from the evidence the plaintiff is unable to make out his case, judgment should be entered for the defendant, and not merely should the plaintiff be non-suited.  (v) The rationale is the same was for (iii) above: see Eduful v. Pantsil (supra); the court may direct that notwithstanding the non-suit, the plaintiff shall be at liberty to bring fresh suit: see Order 40, r.3;  (vi) the court is entitled to set aside any judgment of non-suit in any case of surprise, mistake, or accident: see Order 40, r.3;  (vii) the court may non-suit the plaintiff without any application by the defendant: see Order 40, r.1;  (viii) the court may non-suit a plaintiff even after judgment when a motion for a retrial or review is brought. see Order 40, r.2, and Order 42, r.1 of Cap. 4.  In the instant case the grounds of appeal were formulated thus:  \[p.204\]  ""1. The trial magistrate erred in law when he held that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff is caught by the provision in Cap.4, Order 40 and therefore should be non-suited.  2\. The trial magistrate erred in law by not allowing other witnesses for the plaintiff to testify so as to appreciate the weight of the totality of evidence in favour of the plaintiff�s case.  3\. The learned trial magistrate erred in law by allowing a non-suit application prematurely.""  He therefore prayed that the judgment of the district court grade 1 be set aside and judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff-appellant.  Ground (1) has to do with the elements constituting the tortious heads under which the damages were sought. There is first the tort of false imprisonment and, next, malicious prosecution. On false imprisonment, first it meant the complete deprivation of liberty for any time, however short, without lawful justification, and thus the starting point in the consideration of a case of false imprisonment was the point where total restraint was imposed: see Atta v. Amoasi \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 201, C.A., holding (1). In the case of Narwu v. Armah \[1972\] 2 G.L.R. 331, C.A. it was held (as stated in the headnote) that:  "". . . where a complainant gives information to a police officer and the officer acts according to his own judgment and makes an arrest, the complainant incurs no responsibility in tort for false imprisonment, but where a complainant does not merely give information but directs the officer to effect the arrest, the officer in that case is considered as the servant of the complainant for that purpose and the complainant will incur liability in the tort of false imprisonment ...  Malice on the part of the appellant does not displace the necessity for the respondent to prove actual direction or authorisation.""  This last cited case was relied on in the case of Appiah v. Mensah \[1978\] G.L.R. 342, where the court found that the conduct of the first defendant went beyond that of a person merely making a complaint in that he led the other defendants who were soldiers to the house of the plaintiff to arrest him, provided transport to convey the plaintiff and went with the soldiers to seize the tractor of the plaintiff and to arrest him.  In this case the plaintiff testified that on the first day the defendant and the police came to his house to arrest him but met him absent. He reported himself to the police as instructed and was kept in custody. Whilst in custody the defendant came and identified him to a \[p.205\] policeman who thereafter assaulted and detained him. Having led the police to the plaintiff, having been arrested by the police, the defendant if he was a mere informer, would have no business doing with the plaintiff�s detention again. Yet he came to the police station and pointed the plaintiff out to a particular policeman. It was after this that the plaintiff was even told the reason for his arrest. These material facts were never challenged in cross-examination, and in the absence of any rebuttal evidence, these facts were deemed to have been admitted by the respondent. The respondent's conduct, prima facie, did not suggest a person whose only interest in the matter was to make a genuine complaint against the plaintiff. It was held in the Atta v. Amoasi case (supra), holding (6), that whether an arrest had been procured by the defendants was a question of fact which had to be determined by the trial judge. In the instant case the learned trial magistrate made no findings of fact at all. So that he could not non-suit the plaintiff since he had not found as a fact on the evidence that the plaintiff's arrest was not directed or authorised by the defendant. In this respect he erred.  Similarly, he made no finding of fact with regard to the second claim founded on malicious prosecution. What a plaintiff must allege and establish in order to succeed in an action based on malicious prosecution has been neatly set out by the Supreme Court in the case of Soadwah alias Sondura v. Obeng \[1966\] G.L.R. 338. The learned trial magistrate did not consider at all whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff could at least support a prima facie case of malicious prosecution. Having made no findings of fact in the first place, the learned trial magistrate also failed completely to give any reasons for accepting the submission of the respondent's counsel as against that of the appellant's counsel. The need to give reasons for any judgment cannot be over emphasised especially where, as in this case, a party is being thrown out of court with costs against him. On the need to give reasons see the following Court of Appeal cases: R. v. Sarpong \[1959\] G.L.R. 383 at 386, C.A. and Darke IV v. Darke IX \[1981\] G.L.R. 145 C.A. Thus for the reasons: (i) that the plaintiff's evidence raised a prima facie case of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution; (ii) that the learned trial magistrate failed completely to make any findings of facts; and (iii) that he failed to give any reasons for accepting the submission and also for his decision, the first ground of appeal succeeds.  I believe the second and third grounds can be taken together since the third appears to be a derivative of the second. Those grounds touch on rules of evidence and more importantly on the audi alteram patem rule. Where an oral hearing is given, a court must, it has been \[p.206\] laid down, (a) consider all relevant evidence which a party wishes to submit, and (b) allow witnesses to be questioned, etc: see R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner; Ex parte Moore \[1965\] 1 Q.B. 456, C.A. The right to call and to cross-examine a witness is therefore, as a general rule, part of the procedure required by natural justice: see Osgood v. Nelson (1872) L.R. 5 H.L. 636.  Counsel for the appellant said he intimated to the trial court that he intended calling a police officer as a witness. But the record is totally silent on this. Counsel for the respondent said he did not hear any such request made. Certainly the appellant was entitled at the trial to call such evidence as would help him establish his claim. And if such admissible evidence has been rejected by the trial court and substantial injustice thereby occasioned, the injured party is entitled to a new trial provided he formally tendered such evidence at the trial and requested the trial court to make a note of the point, or, if that request be refused, to enter an exception upon the record: see Campbell v. Loader \[1865\] L.J.Ex.58; Gibbs v. Pike (1842) 9 M & W 351; Whitehouse v. Hemmant (1858) 27 L.J.Ex. 295 and Penn v. Bibby (1866) L.R.3 Eq. 308. If this is not done at the trial I do not think it will be open to the affected party to challenge the trial court's record on appeal. As the Court of Appeal held in Mensah v. Adu \[1972\] 2 G.L.R. 218 at 225, C.A. � adopting the words from Huffer v. Allen (1866) L.R. 2 Exch. 115 whilst the order of the court stands and forms part of its record, the parties are estopped from denying the correctness of the order. However:  �. . . it is always open to the court on a motion to correct the order, so as to relieve any party who may be unduly prejudiced by any act done under its order, and to prevent any injurious consequences which may flow from the error.�  Counsel for the appellant on receipt of the appeal record could have applied to the court below to rectify the record if he felt there was an error in it. Having failed to do so he cannot complain to this court which did not do the recording. In this case at the end of the appellant's evidence there is nothing on the record to show that counsel intimated he was calling additional evidence. Nor in his address in reply to the submission of the respondent counsel did he mention that he had not closed his case. Hence the submission was premature. In reality he replied to the submission on its merits. I am thus unable to hold that the appellant was denied his right of being heard. However in view of my holding that the plaintiff's evidence raised a prima facie case, I think the submission of non-suit was wrongly received and this I think has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. I therefore set aside the lower court's order and order a trial de \[p.207\] novo. I must here point out that on this new trial the case must be proved afresh, for it is contrary to principle to allow a new trial for the purpose of calling further evidence where the plaintiff being professionally represented, did not call such evidence when available: see Devenish v. P. D. I. Homes (Hythe) Ltd. \[1959\] 1 W.L.R. 1188. I also set aside the costs awarded and if already paid by the appellant it should be refunded to him. I award no cost in this appeal.

"On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court by a four to one majority decision (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (No 2) \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on 20 December 1988 (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 532, CA) which had allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the decision of the trail judge, Benin J. By the said judgment, the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that in purporting to declare redundancy, the defendants, the employers, had failed to follow the procedural machinery set up under the collective agreement entered into by the parties in breach of section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) and that the plaintiffs, the employees, were entitled to a declaration that the purported termination of their employment was null and void and of no effect and that the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal had erred in holding otherwise. The Supreme Court further held that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive them to the dates of their respective de facto termination, including an additional twelve months' salary (awarded by the trial court) as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of the de facto termination of their employment. It was also held that as the termination of their employment was held to be void, they remained employees de jure and would therefore be entitled to earned leave allowance, bonus, including food packages and all other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman agreement basis - all of which should be converted into cash if feasible as at the respective dates of the plaintiffs' de facto dismissal. It was also held that in calculating their entitlements, accounts should be taken of any period within which any employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by the award. In the instant application by the plaintiffs for a review \[p.514\] of the majority judgment of the Supreme Court, counsel for the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that: (i) having declared their dismissal a nullity, the plaintiffs remained de jure in the employment of the defendants and therefore the Supreme Court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of the judgment as damages for unlawful dismissal and not the mere twelve months' salary granted by the trial court and affirmed by the Supreme Court; (ii) that in any event, the plaintiffs were entitled to nothing less than two years' salary as damages following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA; and (iii) since courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship, ergo an employee whose dismissal had been declared void and of no effect (as in the instant case) could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out.  Held, dismissing the application: (1) the applicants had failed to show the existence of exceptional circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  Per curiam. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit of inappropriate and undeserving cases.  Per Osei-Hwere JSC. The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to mitigation of damages. Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137 cited.  Per Aikins JSC. I have considered ... the argument of counsel for the applicants, and regret that I am not at all convinced to accede to the application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge \[by his decision affirmed by the Supreme Court\] acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unapproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.  (2) Per Francois JSC, Amua-Sekyi JSC and Ofori-Boateng JA. The two-years salary award as damages for unlawful dismissal made in the Agbettoh case, was a reasonable compromise - not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period was certain (as in the instant case, with twelve or fourteen months as the expected period of lay-offs) it was unnecessary to determine the reasonable period. The time stated was itself definitive of reasonableness. Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA explained.  Per Francois JSC. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants because their termination has been declared null and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case...The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.  \[p.515\]  Per Osei-Hwere JSC. In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise, the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendants from dismissing them or specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages.  \[EDITORIAL NOTE: Decision of the Supreme Court in Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (No 2) \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante affirmed.\]  CASES REFERRED TO  (1) Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC.

The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Osei-Hwere JSC.  \[p.516\]  COUNSEL  Jones-Mensah for the applicants.  Thompson for the respondents (holding brief for George Bannerman).  JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS JSC.  On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court delivered its decision in the above appeal: (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC). Before 26 November 1987 that decision would have conclusively ended this protracted matter. The significance of 26 November 1987 is that it marked the advent of an epoch-making decision: the ruling in Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC which held that this Court had power to review its own judgments and consequently formulated tests for the institu COUNSEL  Jones-Mensah for the applicants.  Thompson for the respondents (holding brief for George Bannerman).  JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS JSC.  On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court delivered its decision in the above appeal: (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC). Before 26 November 1987 that decision would have conclusively ended this protracted matter. The significance of 26 November 1987 is that it marked the advent of an epoch-making decision: the ruling in Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC which held that this Court had power to review its own judgments and consequently formulated tests for the institution of the review jurisdiction. Since then, a number of applications for review have been determined by this court. The synthesised ratio for success is the existence of exceptional circumstances negating the soundness of a decision and compelling its vacation to obviate a miscarriage of justice.  The review jurisdiction, it has been emphasised ad nauseam, is not another avenue for appeal or a forum for canvassing lost causes. Unfortunately, if the statistics are any guide, this appears to be the erroneous perception of a number of litigants. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit inappropriate and undeserving cases. The absence of a rigid definition notwithstanding, what is exceptional can hardly escape notice. A few examples have been given in previous rulings of this court and need no reiteration.  This court normally would resist the temptation of being drawn into expatiating on its judgment with explanations or justifications. This inhibition cannot, however, extend over mischievous or wilful misreading of all important precedent upon which a decision rests.  In Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA, the court made pronouncements which ensured that statutorily protected contracts would retain their protection under the aegis of the court's jurisdiction. This decision in certain areas, deviated from the beaten track of master and servant contractual relationships well-known in Anglo-American jurisprudence. The applicants herein aridly dismiss the Agbettoh decision as affording no legal solace. That decision is repudiated as: ""not founded on any principle known to the law"", and occasioning ""a fundamental error.""  If that were the case, one wonders why an exercise for a review has been embarked upon at all. For it was upon the superstructure of Agbettoh that the applicants' victory was founded. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants, Valco, because their termination has been declared null \[p.517\] and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case. The intervention of the court upon the applicants' institution of a claim in legal proceedings, brought an end to the status held by the parties prior to the suit. The court merely moved on to make just awards from a de facto situation.  The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case, also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.  A two-year award was a reasonable compromise, not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period is certain, as in the instant case, with twelve months or fourteen months as the expected period of lay offs, no arithmetic is required to determine a reasonable period. The time stated is itself definitive of reasonableness. In the calculation of the three batches of employees laid off at various dates, it is agreed that a mathematical error occurred in computing the third batch as deserving a twelve-month award instead of fourteen. This error could have been corrected under the slip rule for which provision has been made under article 116 (4) of the Constitution, 1979. There was no need for a full blown review.  I set out accordingly, what I consider a relevant extract in the Agbettoh case (supra) at 131-132:  ""It follows that in so far as the plaintiffs sought to have it declared that their purported retirements were a nullity inasmuch as they violated a constitutional injunction, they were entitled to that declaration. The plaintiffs did not themselves seek the declarations in those terms and beyond stating that the respondents were \`entitled to all the reliefs indorsed on their writ', the judge below did not direct his mind to the declarations sought. But inasmuch as what we have held can be said to be the substance of the declaratory reliefs granted to the plaintiffs, we affirm them.  With regard to the claim in the nature of perpetual injunction to restrain the board from ejecting them from their bungalows and the payment of salaries, we see some practical difficulties. It would be unreal to assume that the status quo in 1979 still exists five years afterwards in 1984. Clearly, the plaintiffs have not \[p.518\] worked for the board all these years. They themselves were under an obligation to minimise their losses by seeking and obtaining alternative jobs. For all we know, they may well have found themselves other jobs and have been comfortably settled. To affirm today an order which secures them bungalows which they only had when they were in the actual service of the board or to order that salaries be paid to them for those years when they did not work for the board, albeit through no fault of their own, would be to set our face against realities. The reality of the situation is that although de jure they are still technically in the service of the board, de facto they have ceased to be so since November 1979.  In all the circumstances, we think we should mark our disapproval of their unconstitutional retirement by ordering that the appellant board pay each as compensation, two years' salary from November 1979. They should also, of course, receive their other entitlements under their contracts of service or under the board's scheme. In so far as the judge's orders properly construed, enjoin the board to keep them as it were perpetually in their residential accommodation and to pay them salaries and other benefits as if they were in actual rather than constructive service of the board, those orders ought not to be allowed to stand. We disaffirm and set them aside.""  It is a basic requirement for all courts which practice equity, to deny unjust enrichment to all suitors. No court should allow unmerited largesse to the detriment of an innocent party. It was upon this well-known notion of fairness that this court declared that those plaintiffs who had secured employment before the dates stated in their respective ""Leave of absence without pay/recall"" (LOA) programmes-which had been negotiated between the defendants and the local union of the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of the Trades Union Congress of Ghana (ICU) had run out, would have such earnings taken into account in the final calculation of their just deserts. Indeed it is trite law that the applicants herein had a duty to mitigate their losses. It would therefore have been illogical and a legal breach if such earnings were not subject to deductions.  Finally, this court ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for their entitlements to be calculated. It is patent that all entitlements are open for consideration at that forum, even the indices of money depreciation. Save for the correction affecting the fourteen months' entitlement of the third batch of employees who were laid off, I think this application is without merit and must be dismissed.  \[p.519\]  JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI JSC.  I agree.  JUDGMENT OF OFORI-BOATENG JA.  I also agree.  JUDGMENT OF OSEI-HWERE JSC.  The applicants' motion prays for a review of the judgment of this court delivered on 8 March 1990: see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante. The judgment varied, to the advantage of the applicants, the decision of the Court of Appeal. It particularly decreed, contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal and of the trial court, that the termination of the appointments of all the plaintiff-applicants including an unspecified number who were trainees, was null and void. The two courts below had dismissed the action as against the trainees and had held that the dismissal of the successful plaintiffs was only wrongful and not void. The Court of Appeal had, by obvious inadvertence, seemingly confined its pecuniary awards on to those of the first batch of dismissed employees so entitled to the said awards but the judgment of this court had corrected the error and extended the awards to all the employees of the second and third batches as well.  The period during which the employees were forced to stay at home in terms of the LOA programme presented no difficulty. All the three graduated courts were in common agreement that the successful plaintiffs were to be paid their salaries and other entitlements for that period. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeal allowed an additional two months' salary in lieu of notice. This court rejected the two months' salary. The trial judge additionally allowed, by way of damages, twelve months' salary. The Court of Appeal whittled it down to four months' salary. The decision of this court, however, restored the twelve months awarded by the court of first instance. On top of these awards it revived and allowed the claim of the plaintiffs based on the so-called ""gentleman's agreement"" such as the food packages, which the two courts below had rejected. Like the Court of Appeal, this court also allowed the plaintiffs their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement.  One would have thought that, having retrieved large chunks of their benefits thrown away, the plaintiffs would have found final contentment. But not so the implacable plaintiffs. They hunger for more benefits and to be satisfied they call for a review of those parts of the judgment of this court which dissatisfy them. They have set these down as follows:  ""(a) The order that the plaintiffs' salaries, benefits and entitlements be paid effective from the respective dates of the Plaintiff's de facto terminations, ie 31 October 1982, 6 February 1984, and 15 November 1984.  \[p.520\]  (b) The order awarding the plaintiffs only twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal from the effective dates of their \`wrongful dismissal.'  (c) The order tending to restrict \`all other benefits' to those said to be enjoyed under a so-called gentleman's agreement (which might rashly be interpreted by the defendants to exclude the bi-annual supply of cloths, VIP entitlement, proven hospitalisation, proven children's educational and also medical expenses, etc.)  (d) The order for payment of their other entitlements under article 40.  (e) The order that the third batch of the plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983-15 November 1984.  (f) The order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards.""  The thrust of the argument of counsel for the applicants in support was that since this court decreed the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs to be null and void the effect was that even as at the date of the said decision they remained still in the employment of the defendants. Consequently this court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of judgment by way of damages and not the mere salary for twelve months as ordered. In the case of the first batch of dismissed employees, for instance, they would have scored a period of 34 months from the date of the so-called de facto termination of their appointments to the date of judgment for the purpose of calculating their salaries and entitlements.  It was contended that, at worst, the employees should have been entitled to nothing less than two years' salary (and entitlements) following the decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA-recognised by this court as the king-bolt directing its award of damages to the plaintiffs.  Granted the self-conviction of the applicants in the justice of their motion for review, it is quite obvious that it (the motion) was motivated by their lustful flirtation with the collective agreement contained in exhibit F. The said exhibit F which took effect from I September 1986 replaced exhibit A and provided for more enhanced conditions of service. It stands to reason that the applicants could only benefit under the enhanced exhibit F if this court could be persuaded to stretch the period for the calculation of damages over and above the effective date of exhibit F. The defendant-respondents oppose the motion on the ground that the judgment touching those matters \[p.521\] complained of do not contain any fundamental and basic error giving rise to a gross miscarriage of justice. On the contrary, they made bold to say that if there should be any review at all it should, for instance, be for the purpose of correcting the error of making an award based on the gentleman's agreement which, according to the defendants, was clearly not justiciable and had no foundation in contract.  Some recent decisions of this court have exposed the paradigm for invoking its review jurisdiction. And here I refer particularly to decisions like Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC and Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC. The central theme of these decisions is that the applicant must be able to point at some exceptional circumstances giving rise to a miscarriage of justice before the Supreme Court will be inclined to review its own decision. Although the Supreme Court may not use its review jurisdiction to embark on an apologia, yet I cannot wholly resist the temptation to consider the instant application, if only to chase away some of the lingering cobwebs floating in the minds of the disputants.  In this regard it will be useful to appreciate the status of the plaintiffs. At common law there is no requirement that an employer should proceed in a particular manner before he dismisses an employee. There is no obligation to comply with the rules of natural justice: see Ridge v Baldwin \[1964\] AC 40, HL; and the failure to warn, consult or allow an employee to state his case prior to dismissal cannot affect the validity of his dismissal: see Pepper v Webb \[1969\], 2 All ER 216, CA and Wilson v Racher \[1974\] ICR 428. The only situation in which the common law guarantees procedural rights to working people is where it can be established that there is an element of public employment or service, or some degree of statutory regulation, or that the employment is something in the character of an office: see Mallock v Aberdeen Corporation \[1971\] 2 All ER 1278, HL. The plaintiffs held no public offices which gave them basic rights to the security of their jobs. The collective agreement which permitted the employer's right to terminate an employee's appointment with notice did not assure the plaintiffs their basic rights to the security of their jobs. Rather, by confirming a collective agreement, the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) accords all workmen that come within the ambit of the legislation, procedural rights or safeguards which are, without doubt, a considerable advance towards building for employees a more secure form of job rights.  The dispute that resulted in the final judgment for which a review is now being sought was, to me, unfortunate to the extreme. It focused on how in the complex field of employment protection a procedural \[p.522\] arm of industrial relations law could strike with a resounding slap at even the most conscientious and fair-minded employer who in handling redundancy dismissals, was concerned in formulating a ""survival plan"" with the local representatives of the workers themselves. Be that as it may, our decision that the breach of the statutory procedure rendered the dismissals of the plaintiffs a nullity was no ground to disturb the quantum of the damages awarded (except to correct an arithmetical error) and expand it up to the date of judgment.  In the statements filed on behalf of the plaintiffs before the appeal came to be heard their counsel spared no pains in fully arguing the case for the payment of salaries up to the date of judgment. The review application sought to reargue the same case. It had been contended, by relying on a number of foreign authorities, that the courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship. Ergo an employee whose dismissal was void could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out. My reading of the cases cited in support clearly demonstrate that there were special circumstances which invited the courts to make any such orders.  In Hill v C A Parsons & Co Ltd \[1972\] I Ch 305, CA for instance, the plaintiff was due to retire in two years time and was likely to benefit from Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 which was about to take effect when his appointment was terminated by one month's notice instead of six months'. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from implementing the notice on the grounds that in the exceptional circumstances of the relationship between the parties and the plaintiff's likely protection by the coming into operation of Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 before a fresh notice could take effect, his contract of employment was still subsisting and damages not being at all adequate remedy, he was entitled to the interim injunction. Again in Jones v Lee (1911) 106 LT 123 it was held on appeal that the plaintiff had a right to be heard and represented before any decision relating to his dismissal was taken by the defendants who had acted wrongly in purporting to dismiss him and that interlocutory injunction should be granted. Each case, ultimately, must be decided on its own merit.  In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendant from dismissing them or for specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages. Although the courts strive to arrive at what is fair and just in their awards of damages for wrongful or illegal termination of employment such \[p.523\] awards are bound to be irrational as they proceed from the discretion of individual judges and the circumstances for the awards may hardly remain the same. It is only natural that this irrationality is also bound to breed disquiet in industrial relations.  Whatever be the progressive trend by the courts elsewhere towards shielding employees from undue hardship resulting from illegal dismissals which counsel for the plaintiffs has commended for our espousal, that trend has today been halted in England by legislation to inject some sanity, at least, in the award of damages for wrongful or illegal redundancy dismissal. The relevant legislation is the Employment Protection Act, 1975. Under the said Act, an employer proposing to dismiss as redundant an employee of a description in respect of which an independent trade union is recognised by him, is obliged to consult representatives of that trade union about the dismissal at the earliest opportunity, but in any event where he proposes to dismiss ten or more employees at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, at least 60 days before the first of those dismissals takes effect-section 99. Under section 101, an appropriate trade union may present a complaint to an industrial tribunal on the ground that an employer has dismissed or proposes to dismiss as redundant one or more employees and has not complied with any of the requirements of section 99. Where the tribunal finds the complaint well-founded it shall make a declaration to that effect and it may also make a protective award which will oblige the employer to pay remuneration for a protected period.  The protected period, under the same section 101 (5) is:  "". . . a period beginning with the date on which the first of the dismissals to which the complaint relates takes effect, or the date of the award, whichever is earlier, of such length as the tribunal shall determine to be just and equitable in all the circumstances having regard to the seriousness of the employer's default in complying with any requirement of section 99 (of the Act) ...  in the case of a proposal to dismiss 100 or more employees within a period of 90 days. In a case where more than ten employees are to be dismissed at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, the period is 60 days, and in any other case it is 28 days. By section 102 of the Act, any payment under a protective award in respect of any period shall go towards discharging any liability of the employer under, or in respect of breach of the contract of employment in respect of that period.  In Talke Fashions Ltd v Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades \[1978\] 2 All ER 649, EAT it was held that the intention of the legislation in dealing with industrial relations was to \[p.524\] compensate an employee for the loss he had suffered by reason of unfair treatment by his employer and not to impose penalties on the employer for his default. It was held further (as stated in the headnote at 650) that:  ""The making of a protective award under s 101 (3) was discretionary, but if an award was to be made its period was at large up to a fixed maximum. The primary consideration in determining the period of the award was the effect on the employee of the employer's failure to consult his union, bearing in mind that, by s 101 (5), the period of the award was to be linked to the period of notice required by s 99 to be given to the union for consultation. Although the seriousness of the employer's default was by s 101 (5), a factor to be taken into consideration and might increase the period of the award, it was to be considered not in isolation but in relation to the consequences to the employee of the failure to consult, and the fact that there had been serious default on the part of the employer did not mean that the maximum protective award was to be made unless the employer showed mitigating circumstances . . .""  Again in Spillers-French (Holdings) Ltd v Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers \[1980\] 1 All ER 231 it was held that:  ""(i) The purpose of a protective award was to compensate for an employer's failure to consult the appropriate union within the required time in respect of proposed dismissals for redundancy, and not merely to compensate for loss or potential loss of the employees' remuneration. The relevant factors, therefore, in deciding whether to make a protective award were the number of days of consultation lost by the employer's breach of s 99 of the 1975 Act and the seriousness of the breach.""  In my opinion there is an urgent call for reform of the law on the lines of the Employment Protection Act, 1975 which will permit the court to make protective awards within a protected period. It is enough to say that as compared to what their counterparts would have received under a protective award the plaintiffs have exceedingly enjoyed the largesse of the court for which they should remain grateful.  Apart from holding that de jure the plaintiffs were all still employees and for that reason they were entitled to the food packages and all the other benefits enjoyed on the basis of a so-called gentleman's agreement, the majority judgment of this court did not advance any other reasons for so holding. It is clear that the specific awards made under head (c) of the majority decisions fall under the \[p.525\] rubric of ""benefits."" The food packages were clearly an incentive or productive bonus worked into the wages structure. This is confirmed by exhibit J. For the avoidance of doubt I feel that it will be necessary to define benefits since the awards under head (c) include ""all the other benefits.""  The term ""benefits"" as employed in an ""agreement"" between an employer and his employee is in my view synonymous with ""remuneration."" In S & U Stores Ltd v Lee \[1969\] 2 All ER 417, the court (Lord Parker CJ, Melford Stevenson and Blain JJ) had to define ""remuneration."" It was held that ""remuneration"" was not mere payment for work done but was what the doer expected to get as the result of the work he did in so far as what he expected to get was quantified in terms of money. The above definition was, however, not followed in S & U Stores Ltd v Wilkes \[1974\] 3 All ER 401, NIRC. Here the court laid down the test for determining ""remuneration"" as (1) any sum paid as a wage or salary without qualification is part of the employee's remuneration; (2) the value of any benefit in kind (eg free accommodation) or paid in cash by someone other than the employer is to be disregarded as not forming part of the remuneration; (3) any sum which is agreed to be paid by way of reimbursement or on account of expenditure incurred by the employee to the extent that that sum represented a profit or surplus in his hands rather than a genuine reimbursement of expenditure. See also section 35 (2) of the Labour Regulations, 1969 (LI 632) where the expression ""full pay"" is defined as ""the worker's normal remuneration (without overtime payment) including the cash equivalent of any remuneration in kind.""  I would opt for the definition in Wilkes' case. It follows from the above definition that the value of any benefit in kind paid or supplied by the employer, such as the food package, will form part of the ""remuneration"" or ""benefits."" With this test it should not be difficult to ascertain the ""other benefits"" enjoyed by the plaintiffs.  The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to the mitigation of damages: see Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137, EAT. Except as to the minor correction which is to be made in calculating the awards in respect of the third batch, I would also dismiss the motion.  JUDGMENT OF AIKINS JSC.  The defendants in this case, the Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (popularly referred to as Valco), are a limited liability company operating in Tema, and the plaintiffs were employees of the defendants. Their conditions of employment are spelt out in a \[p.526\] collective agreement which their union, the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) entered into on their behalf with Valco, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299).  The trial judge, Benin J, after hearing evidence from the plaintiffs and the defendants, delivered judgment in which he held, after a thorough consideration and careful evaluation of the evidence, that ""most of the plaintiffs were wrongfully dismissed by the defendant - company"", and that some of the plaintiffs who were said to be persons trained by the defendants with a view to being employed at a later date, were not members of the union and were specifically excluded from the operation of the collective agreement. He therefore rejected their claim in its entirety. He further found that the LOA programme was negotiated to cover only those workers who were sent home on I November 1982. The learned trial judge further held that the plaintiffs who had made out their case were not entitled to be reinstated in their posts, and awarded them damages for wrongful dismissal made up of the following:  ""(1) salary up to 1 January 1984, the date by which they were to consider themselves as having been declared redundant under the LOA programme if they had not been recalled;  (2) twelve months' salary being a reasonable period after 1 January 1984 within which they could seek alternative employment;  (3) two months' salary for being declared redundant without notice; and  (4) leave allowance, bonus, long service awards as at the date they were sent home, provided these were earned, but had not been already paid to them.""  He excluded claims for food packages and other claims founded on what the plaintiffs referred to as a gentleman's agreement and which they contended they would have been entitled to if they had not been dismissed. He ordered that they should refund the amounts they received as loans in the implementation of the LOA programme.  From this judgment both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs' complaint covered the following matters:  (1) The decision that trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.  (2) The decision that the termination of the respective appointments of the plaintiffs were only wrongful and not void.  (3) The decision that the food packages did not form part of the plaintiffs' enforceable conditions of service.  \[p.527\]  (4) The restriction of the compensation to twelve months.  (5) Inadequate and unreasonable awards.  The defendants' appeal covered the whole of the decision save the following:  (1) The judge's decision in regard to the trainees.  (2) His decision rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void.  (3) His holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to food packages and other benefits said to be due to them on a gentleman's agreement basis.  By a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court holding:  (a) that the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs for wrongful termination of their employment;  (b) rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void; and  (c) that the trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.  With respect to damages the Court of Appeal by a majority of two to one held that the plaintiffs were entitled to four months' salary as at 31 December 1983 in addition to the two months, salary in lieu of notice, and ordered as follows:  ""The parties are hereby ordered to appear before the court below to calculate how much is due to each of the successful plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from the date of termination to 31 December 1983 and all other entitlements such as earned leave allowance, bonus, long service award, and end of service benefits as at the date each of them was laid off as provided for under the collective agreement ... These to be determined as at 31 December 1983.  (b) Four months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (c) Two months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (d) Their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement.""  From this judgment the plaintiffs and the defendants each appealed to the Supreme Court.  On 8 March 1990 this court (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) by a majority of four to one, after an exhaustive consideration of the evidence and reasoning, held that the purported termination of the plaintiffs' employment was null and void and of no effect, and should be accordingly vacated. The court also held that the trainees were employees who were subject to the provisions of the collective \[p.528\] agreement, the moment they joined Valco, and they were wrongfully dismissed, their dismissal being null and void and of no effect.  This court therefore ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the plaintiffs including the trainee plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive salaries to the dates of their respective de facto termination which are I April 1984, 6 February 1984 and 15 November 1984 respectively and so in the case of the first batch:  (i) from 31 October 1982 to 1 January 1984; and. in the case of the second batch:  (ii) from 7 February 1983 to 6 February 1984; and in the case of the third batch:  (iii) from 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984.  (b) For all the plaintiffs additional twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of their de facto termination,  (c) Since it has been held that de jure they are still employees having declared their dismissals null and void they will be entitled to leave allowance, bonus, long service awards, including food packages and all the other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman's agreement, all these to be converted if feasible to cash as at the respective dates of their de facto termination.  (d) Their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement.  Finally this court ordered that the plaintiffs fulfil their obligation to repay the loans granted to them under the LOA agreement in accordance with its terms as to period of payment, if they have not already done so. The court further ordered that in calculating the entitlements, account should be taken of any period within which an employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by that award.  It is from this judgment that the plaintiffs have applied to this court again for a review of the judgment. Mr Jones-Mensah, counsel for the plaintiffs, urged before us that to compensate rights and entitlements declared de jure with only twelve months' damages, can only mean that there is no jurisprudential difference between the verdict of wrongful dismissal and that of a declaration of nullity in terms of relief, and cited the case of Sowah v Bank for Housing and Construction \[1982-83\] GLR 1324, SC, emphasising the rate of inflation in the economy and the decline in the purchasing power of the cedi.  \[p.529\]  In reply counsel for the defendants, Mr Thompson who held brief for Mr Bannerman, persuaded us in very strong terms that a party invoking the review jurisdiction of the court must show that there are exceptional circumstances which call for a review, ie (i) a fundamental and basic error may have inadvertently been committed by the court; and (ii) the error must have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice and he quoted in support of his contention a passage from the case of Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC.  He further submitted that such an application for review should not be used for an interpretation of the court's decision or directions from the court or for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. He urged that the principle on which the de facto termination date was fixed for each batch was taken from the Court of Appeal decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984- 86\] 1 GLR 122 CA, the relevant part of which was quoted at 372 ante of the majority judgment in this case . The question, he argued, was considered by the court and the applicants have not shown that there is a fundamental and basic error which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice to them.  The views of this court on the issue were succinctly stated in the majority judgment delivered on 8 March 1990 where Taylor JSC after referring to the cases of Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra); Hemans v Ghana National Trading Corporation \[1978\] GLR 4 and the view of Dorman CJ in Harlley v Harman (1840) 3 ER 617, said at 371 ante:  ""It follows from those authorities that I accept and adopt the reasoning of Apaloo CJ in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra) and I agree with the views of Archer JA (as he then was) in the Hemans case (supra). In the instant case, the trial High Court judge gave adequate reasons in the exercise of his discretion in awarding twelve months' salary as the measure of damages for each plaintiff. In the Agbettoh case (supra) two years' salary was awarded. I think the well-known practice in the conduct of appeals is that where a judge has used his discretion in arriving at a decision, then unless it can be demonstrated that he ignored the law or took into consideration facts that he ought to have excluded or omitted material facts which should have been considered, his conclusion should not be interfered with. Applying this principle, I am unable to appreciate the reasons why the twelve months' period chosen by Benin J in the exercise of his discretion was set aside and I would therefore restore it.""  \[p.530\]  I have considered very carefully the arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs, and regret that I am not at all convinced that I should accede to his application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.  As recent as 1962 when this court was dealing with appeals from the exercise of the court's discretion in the case of Crentsil v Crentsil \[1962\] 2 GLR 171 at 175, SC it emphasised that:  ""...it is a rule of law deep rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of court's discretion save in exceptional circumstances.""  For example, this court would not interfere with the exercise of its discretion on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials, or gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters. In this application no significant exceptional circumstances of proven weight have been urged on this court by counsel for the applicants to warrant interference with exercise of the trial judge's discretion. The application for review on this ground is therefore rejected.  The next ground argued before us by counsel for the applicants is in respect of the order of the court that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards. Counsel urged that since this is a case of invalidated termination, ie one of nullity and not one of wrongful dismissal, it makes no difference in law whether an employee got other employment or not, and is entitled to the full benefit.  Counsel for the defendant thinks that this ground is baseless. He argues that as the LOA exercise has been held not to be one of redundancy and therefore to be null and void, and as the plaintiffs have been held to have been wrongfully dismissed, the benefits they would be entitled to under article 40 of the collective agreement would be those accruing on termination on their employment. It is my view that counsel for the plaintiffs has failed to convince this court of his legitimate claims, and this ground of his application is equally rejected.  \[p.531\]  The next and perhaps the most important ground of substance argued before us by counsel for the plaintiffs is in respect of the order of this court that the third batch of plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983 and 15 November 1984. Counsel submitted that there appears to be a small mistake in the dates, and invited the court to take note of the fact that the nullified LOA programme was effected on the third batch from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985 and not 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984, ie a period of fourteen months. Counsel for the defendants concedes this arithmetical error in the dates and sees no objection to the correct dates being substituted.  It is unfortunate that the correct dates the third batch were laid off should inadvertently elude the, observation of both counsel and this court. There is no doubt that the error is fundamental and basic, and has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The application of counsel for the plaintiffs on this ground for a review succeeds and I order the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the third batch of the plaintiffs as follows:  ""Their salaries from the date they ceased to receive salaries to the date of their de facto termination which is from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985, ie a period of fourteen months.""  Save as ordered above in favour of the third batch of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs' application for review fails to satisfy the test laid down by this court and is dismissed.  DECISION  Application dismissed.  L. K. A  NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK v. SUNYANI SAWMILLS LTD. AND OTHERS \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 71-76  HIGH COURT, SUNYANI  29 SEPTEMBER 1988  OWUSU-SEKYERE J.  Contract�Guarantee�Joint and several guarantors�Release of co-guarantor by creditor�Other guarantor not notified and his consent not obtained�Whether other guarantor discharged from liability.  HEADNOTES  In a suit brought by the plaintiff-bank against three defendants ""jointly and severally"" to recover money loaned to the first defendant-company and guaranteed by the second and third defendants together with interest and other charges, the bank without the consent of the first and second defendants and indeed without notifying them discontinued the action against the third defendant. Consequently counsel for the first and second defendants urged the court to strike out the action against them. Counsel for the bank contended, however, that the phrase ""jointly and severally"" must be construed not as two separate and independent words conjoined by the word ""and"" but rather as a legally formulated and adopted phrase with a distinct meaning and which was used in all legal causes or matters arising between parties where an option was left for one party to claim against the others either by taking them together as a joint entity or by proceeding against one or more of such a joint entity. Hence, counsel for the bank submitted that the plaintiff-bank properly exercised an option that was open to it when it discontinued the action against the third defendant.  Held, granting the application in part: since the guarantors to the first defendant-company, the principal debtor, stood jointly and severally, the effect of the discontinuance by the bank of the action against the third defendant, the second guarantor, without notice to the other defendants and without their consent, was that the second defendant was discharged of her liability and responsibility as guarantor to the first defendant. However, since the first defendant-company did not repudiate the contract with the plaintiff-bank and did not say that it had made good the payment, its liabilities were not terminated by the release of the third defendant and the bank could consequently still proceed with the action against it.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS  ACTION by the plaintiff-bank to recover, together with interest and other charges, money loaned to the first defendant and guaranteed by the second and third defendants during the pendency of which the plaintiff-bank discontinued the action against the third defendant whereupon the first and second defendants applied for the dismissal of the action against them. The facts are sufficiently set out in the ruling.  COUNSEL  Sammy Acquaye for the plaintiff.  Obeng-Manu for the defendants.  JUDGMENT OF OWUSU-SEKYERE J.  On 9 February 1987 the plaintiff-bank issued out of this court a writ of summons against the defendants jointly and severally, claiming:  ""1. �17,597,914.19 being the total of an I.D.A. term and working capital loan granted the first defendant and guaranteed by the second and third defendants as well as ten per cent per annum charge as at 31 December 1986 on the I.D.A. term loan of �1,170,872.15 in addition to accumulated interest as at 31 December 1986 of �7,775,981.95 on both I.D.A. loans the repayment of which moneys has been long overdue.  2\. Further accruals of interest and other charges on the outstanding balance from time to time of the I.D.A. term and working capital loans from 1 January 1987 to the date of repayment at the prevailing bank rate (on forestry) of 22 and a half per cent per annum or such other bank rate adjustments as shall be made by the Bank of Ghana in accordance with the heads of agreement between the parties.  3\. The plaintiff further claims against the first defendant alone �384,066.96 being the outstanding balance due and owing from the first defendant as at 16 January 1987 on an overdraft facility of �619,000 granted to the first defendant in June 1984 which facility has since expired.""  \[p.73\]  The writ of summons was accompanied by a statement of claim. The first and second defendants entered appearance through their solicitor at the time, Mr E. Y. Kumi, on 18 February 1987 but the third defendant on 4 February 1987 entered appearance under protest by himself. Then on 1 June 1988, the plaintiff-bank filed summons for judgment seeking leave to sign final judgment against the defendants on the grounds that the defendants had no defence to the action against them. On 24 June 1988 the defendants through their newly appointed solicitor, Mr Obeng-Manu, filed an affidavit in opposition to the summons praying the court to grant them leave to defend the plaintiff�s action. But before the summons could be heard, the plaintiff on 29 August 1988 filed notice of discontinuance against the third defendant in the suit, and as a result the action against the third defendant was discontinued.  When the summons for final judgment came up for hearing on 20 September 1988, counsel for the defendants, Mr Obeng-Manu, raised a point that as a matter of law the action could no longer be prosecuted by the plaintiff-bank on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiff-bank in discontinuing against the third defendant who together with the second defendant were guarantors of the loan to the first defendant, the responsibilities and liabilities of the parties under the contract have been, as he put it, eroded. Counsel maintained that the second defendant in particular has been prejudiced because the bank neither notified the other defendants nor gave reasons for the discontinuance against the third defendant, and that the bank was consequently in breach of the terms of the contract between it and the defendants. In sum, counsel strongly submitted that the liabilities and responsibilities of the second defendant under the contract have come to an end inasmuch as the second defendant stood jointly and severally with the third defendant as grantors to the first defendant, and urged the court to strike out the action because, as he put it, it would be oppressive, unfair, unjust, inequitable, immoral, wrongful and patently illegal for the action to be prosecuted in its present form. Counsel cited the case of Republic v. Military Tribunal; Ex parte Ofosu-Amaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 5 at 10 and 11, C.A. to support his contention.  Replying, counsel for the plaintiff-bank, Mr Sammy Acquaye, submitted that the phrase ""jointly and severally"" must not be construed as two separate and independent words conjoined by the word ""and""; it is a legally formulated and adopted phrase with a distinct meaning, and that under a contract where the parties intend that they be taken together in any legal cause or matter and not individually at anytime whatsoever the appropriate word to employ is ""jointly""; and in a cause or matter where it has been intended that it \[p.74\] should be possible for legal process to issue against one or more of a joint entity, the phrase ""jointly and severally"" has been adopted. Counsel further submitted that ""jointly and severally"" is a simple phrase recognised and adopted by the law in all legal causes or matters arising between parties where an option is being left for one party to claim against others either by taking them together as a joint entity or by proceeding against one or more of such a joint entity if he so desires. Counsel also referred to phrases such as ""joint or several"", ""joint and several"", ""and/or"" in interpretation of legal documents.  On the discontinuance, counsel for the bank submitted that the bank had properly discontinued against the third defendant because, as he said, the bank had the option of deciding whether to take all the defendants as one joint entity or proceed against them severally, or against only the first defendant�the principal debtor�without involving the second and third defendants as guarantors or against the two guarantors without involving the first defendant or against one guarantor alone without the other.  On the issue that the bank has discontinued without reserving the liberty to come back, counsel for the bank submitted that the bank came under Order 26, r. 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A) under which there is no bar to bring fresh action, and submitted that if the first and second defendants so wish, they can join the third defendant in the action themselves.  In this ruling I must pose to myself an evaluative question whether the plaintiff-bank can discontinue the action against the third defendant without notifying the first and second defendants and without their consent, more particularly, the co-guarantor, the second defendant. In fact I was interested in the lecture that counsel on both sides gave to me on English grammar concerning conjunctions used or employed in drafting legal documents. I have made several attempts since their eloquent and edifying lecture to understand the words and phrases used by them but the Oxfordmen did not give me much help when I consulted them; fortunately, I had assistance from the immortal writings of the great law lord, Theo Chorley of the Inner Temple, formerly Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Commercial Law in the University of London; the man who held the general editorship of the Modern Law Review for 34 good years, i.e. from 1937 to 1971; the man who tried successfully to overcome the insularity of English legal thinking and found room in the Modern Law Review for foreign contributors and for contributions on foreign law. In two of his books on banking, Lord Chorley talked about ""joint and several guarantors"", the two magic words ""joint and several"" which both counsel copiously used in their submissions to this court. The great law lord stated at \[p.75\] pages 242-243 in his book entitled Law of Banking (4th ed.) as follows:  ""Guarantees which are to be executed by two or more persons present a number of special problems. First, there is the difference between ""joint"" and ""joint and several"" liability. The two main differences are as follows: (i) where a surety is jointly bound with his co-surety, his liability terminates with his death \[see Other v. Eveson (1855), 3 Drewy 177\] but where his liability is joint and several his liability passes to his personal representatives; (ii) 'there is in the cases of joint contract and joint debt as distinguished from the cases of joint and several contract and joint and several debt, only one cause of action. The party injured may sue at law all the joint contractors or he may sue one . . . but whether an action in the case of a joint debt is brought against one debtor or against all the debtors ... it is for the same cause of action�there is only one cause of action.' \[per Bowen, L.J. in In re Hodgson (1835) 31 Ch.D. 177 at 188.\] It is not surprising, therefore, that when a banker is offered as security a guarantee by two or more persons he invariably insists upon the joint and several liability of the sureties . . .  The form of a joint and several guarantee closely follows that of the individual guarantor. The plural is used throughout instead of the singular, and it must be made perfectly clear that the liability of the sureties is to be joint and several. Furthermore in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the release of one joint and several surety will release the other or others from liability . . . see Mercantile Bank of Sydney v. Taylor \[\[1893\] A.C. 317\]. The rule may be inconvenient to the bank, and therefore it is usual to insert a clause which provides that the bank shall be at liberty to release any surety or to make a composition with any surety without prejudicing the bank's right against the remaining sureties.""  On this topic of contracts of ""joint and several guarantees"" and allied matters, there is a plethora of legal literature or catena of impressive judicial decisions such as National Provincial Bank of England v. Brackenbury (1906) 22 T.L.R. 797; Polak v. Everett (1876) 1 Q.B.D. 669; Ellesmere Brewery Co. v. Cooper \[1896\] 1 Q.B. 75 and Smith v. Wood \[1929\] 1 Ch 14. A release of one partner from a partnership debt discharges all the others for where several persons are bound ""jointly"" or ""jointly and severally"" a release of one is a release of them all: see Granville Williams On Joint Obligations (1949); Lacy v. Kinnaston (1701)1 Ld. Raym 688 and Kiffin v. Willis and Evans (1695) \[p.76\] 4 Mod. 379; and Jenkins v. Jenkins \[1928\] 2 K.B. 501 where a joint and several promissory note was to be discharged by one of the promissors becoming the executive of the premises. See Leading Cases in the Law of Banking (2nd ed.) by Lord Chorley and P. E. Smart at 225.  In the present case, the second and third defendants, the guarantors to the principal debtor, the first defendant, stood jointly and severally as exhibit 2 shows, and I quote:  ""The loan shall be guaranteed jointly and severally as to both principal and interest by the following:  (1) Jacinta Soraya Mamih of Mile 78, Sunyani Road, Sunyani.  (2) Halarius Kwame Ababayi of Plot No. 5 Blk. 8, Dadiesoaba, Kumasi.""  Now as the plaintiff-bank has discontinued against the third defendant, the second guarantor, without notice or consent of the first guarantor, the law says, and I rule, that the second defendant is also discharged of the liability and responsibility of her guarantorship to the first defendant. But since the principal debtor does not repudiate the contract with the plaintiff-bank and does not say that he had made good the payment, I do not agree with counsel for the defendants that his liabilities are also over and that the plaintiff cannot proceed against him in this action. I hold that the first guarantor, i.e. the second defendant, is discharged of her liabilities and responsibilities under the contract. She and the third defendant stood jointly and severally as guarantors for the first defendant but the plaintiff-bank has discontinued the action against the third defendant without the notice and consent of the second defendant, a co-guarantor. However, the action should continue as against the principal debtor, the first defendant.  DECISION  Action dismissed against the second defendant but to continue against the first defendant.  J. K.

"The employees of the defendant-company (Valco) were members of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union of the Trades Union Congress of Ghana (I.C.U.). A collective agreement (exhibit A) negotiated by I.C.U. and Valco under the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299), inter alia, provided by article 14 that in the event of Valco undertaking a redundancy exercise to lay off workers, length of service should be the determining factor, and where a less senior worker was to be retained because of his ability or skill I.C.U. should be informed. Article 14 (e) further provided for two months' notice or two months' salary in lieu thereof for determination of appointments. Article 1 proscribed the entry by any employee into any contract outside exhibit A affecting his service conditions or bonding him to Valco without prior discussion with I.C.U. Valco received electricity for its manufacturing operations from the Volta River Authority (V.R.A.) hydro-electric dam at Akosombo. Following a prolonged drought in the country which affected the generation of electricity from Akosombo, the supply of electricity to Valco was reduced in three stages until Valco had to shut down its production line. Meanwhile in the wake of the power reduction Valco had negotiated with its local union of I.C.U. and the workers defence committee (W.D.C.) a programme called ""Leave of absence without pay/recall programme"" (L.O.A.) under which staff in excess of Valco's labour requirements were to be disengaged for periods of up to fourteen months on condition that if at the end of the period a worker had not been re-engaged he should consider himself redundant with effect from twelve months retrospectively. Each worker was also, inter alia, to be given a farm loan equivalent to what he would have been entitled to under a normal redundancy exercise. In pursuance of the L.O.A., three batches of workers were sent home on 1 November 1982, 7 February 1983 and 31 December 1983 in response to the successive reduction of electricity to Valco. When the plaintiffs, numbering 463 were not recalled after their fourteen months' lay off they brought action against Valco for: (a) damages for wrongful termination of employment; (b) a declaration that the purported termination of their employment was null and void; and (c) arrears of all salary, allowances and benefits due them, on the ground that Valco did not comply with the provisions of exhibit A in dispensing with their services. They contended \[p.343\] that only the I.C.U. could, under exhibit A, negotiate on their behalf and since the L.O.A. was negotiated by the local union and the W.D.C. who lacked capacity to act on their behalf, the L.O.A. was void and they were not bound by it. Valco denied liability and in its defence contended that both the local union and W.D.C. were accredited representatives of the workers and had negotiated the L.O.A. with the full knowledge and consent of all the workers and therefore the plaintiffs were bound by the L.O.A. They furthermore contended that since the L.O.A. gave the plaintiffs more then they would have been entitled to under exhibit A, their action should be dismissed. The trial judge held that a redundancy situation arose at Valco and since Valco had breached the redundancy provisions of article 14 of exhibit A in dispensing with the services of the plaintiffs, their dismissals were wrongful and Valco was liable to pay the plaintiffs damages equivalent to 28 months' salary each�less the farm loans they had taken under the L.O.A.�made up of two months' salary in lieu of notice, salary for the fourteen months they were entitled to stay at home and salary for twelve months which he reckoned as the reasonable period within which they could obtain employment elsewhere. He also granted them all their benefits under exhibit A. He however dismissed, inter alia, their claims for benefits like food packages and X'mas party which they enjoyed outside exhibit A and also their claim for a declaration that the termination of their appointment was a nullity. On appeal by the plaintiffs and a cross-appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeal by its decision (see Nartey-Tokoli v. Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. \[1987-88\] 2 G.L.R. 532 C.A.), allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal. It confirmed, inter alia, the High Court's refusal to declare the plaintiffs' termination as a nullity and by a majority decision upheld the award of two months' salary in lieu of notice but reduced the award of damage for unlawful dismissal from twelve months to four months. By the instant proceedings the plaintiffs appealed and the defendants also cross-appealed to the Supreme Court from the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Held, allowing the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissing the defendants cross-appeal: (per Taylor J.S.C., Francois, Osei-Hwere JJ.S.C. and Ofori-Boateng J.A.): (1) under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299), ss. 5, 6-7 and 10 the agreement (L.O.A.) was, in relation to the collective agreement, invalid and null and void because: (i) the parties who entered into it had no legal capacity to negotiate any employment terms or redundancy conditions for Valco and its employees; (ii) section 10 (2) and (4) of Act 299 specifically and mandatorily denied a right to an employee covered by a collective agreement to waive such rights for new ones; and (iii) in purporting to declare redundancy the defendants did not follow the procedural machinery set up under the collective agreement in breach of section 10 of Act 299. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to a declaration that the purported termination of their employment was null and void and of no effect. Stevenson v. United Road Transport Union \[1977\] 2 All E.R. 941, C.A. and Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 G.L.R. 122, C.A. applied.  Per Taylor J.S.C. (i) When the legislature ... has devised mandatory and imperative provisions for the protection of any employee or any person, an argument that the provisions can be lawfully ignored and another provision said to be beneficial to the employee or person substituted at the discretion of the court or any person is one that a common law judge should not countenance. It is an invidious and dangerous argument subversive of the legal order. Dictum of Lord Loreburn L.C. in Attorney-General v. Birmingham, Tame and Rea Drainage Board \[1912\] A.C. 788 at 795, H.L. cited.  \[p.344\]  (ii) It was a serious matter certainly not conducive to industrial peace, where the machinery which the legislature had carefully devised to give fair hearing to employees and to promote harmony between the employee and the employer was unilaterally ignored by the employer in blatant disregard of the rules of natural justice enshrined in the audi alteram partem principle.  Per Amua-Sekyi J.S.C. dissenting. But a look at section 10 (4) of Act 299 shows that the provision was intended to protect workers from exploitation by their employers; so that if the variation of the collective agreement was to give the worker more rights and benefits than he would have had under the collective agreement, it would be the height of irony if such an agreement were to be declared unlawful. In such a case I believe practical considerations and commonsense would override the strict interpretation of the law.  (2) The measure of damages for wrongful dismissal from employment was not to be confined to only loss of wages or salary but in addition the employee was to receive his entitlements under the contract of employment. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to receive their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive them to the dates of their respective de facto termination, including an additional twelve months' salary (as awarded by the High Court in the exercise of its discretion) as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of the de facto termination of their employment. As the termination of their employment was held to be void and of no legal effect they remained employees de jure and would therefore, be entitled to earned leave allowances, bonus, long service awards, including food packages and all other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman agreement basis; all of which should be converted into cash if feasible as at the respective dates of the plaintiffs' de facto dismissal. They were also to receive their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement. However, in calculating their entitlements, account should be taken of any period within which any employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by the award. Hemans v.

The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Taylor and Amua Sekyi JJ.S.C.  COUNSEL  Jones-Mensah (with him D. K. Letsa) for the appellants.  H. E. Bannerman (with him George Thompson) for the respondents.  JUDGMENT OF TAYLOR J.S.C  I wish to preface this judgment by making some remarks, even if it is considered to be unnecessary, about the rational foundation of our system of justice. The beauty of the judicial system which we have operated in this country for over 100 years, even before our Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 came into force, is that we do not cause parties before us to suffer in their person or pocket without assigning what in our honest view are adequate and convincing reasons why they should be so damnified. And in order to ensure that we do this properly a system of appeals to courts in ascending order of authority has been devised so that, seeing that to err is human, mistakes made by our courts are corrected.  So ingrained, indeed, is this desire to do justice and eliminate human error that as recently as 26 November 1987, in a landmark decision in Fosuhene v. Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 G.L.R. 105, S.C. which is considered in some quarters as revolutionary, we spelled out the circumstances under which we in the very top hierarchy of our judiciary were willing to review even our own errors. I have adverted to this matter because the judgment of the High Court in the case before us was neither fully confirmed by the Court of Appeal nor unanimously rejected by that court. And the eternal search for justice which brings the case now before us as a final appellate court is best vindicated no matter our decision if the consideration which animates our task and dominates our reasoning is fully appreciated by all who appear before us. Justice in our system is best administered when the considered decisions of judges which are challenged, are exposed to the scrutiny of other judicial minds equally conversant with the legal principles at stake.  The case before us now is a dispute involving the duties, liabilities and obligations attaching by law to the master-servant relationship. Its regrettable feature is that through no fault of the master or the servant, a situation has arisen which has generated grievances and led the master and the servant to the law courts. Without a deep appreciation \[p.347\] of the law on the matter and a firm grasp of the facts in issue, it is difficult to imagine, given the arguments of the parties, in what manner the judicial process can operate to do substantial justice to all the parties.  This is a hard case, and it leads me to reflect on what the great American judge and jurist, Holmes J., must have had in mind when in his dissenting opinion in Northern Securities Company v. United States 193 U.S. 197 at 400, he observed that ""hard cases make bad law."" The case is intriguingly simple and yet paradoxically it is intrinsically complex, for this reason it appears to me that, the first step in a rational resolution of the matters in controversy between the parties demands a narration in appropriate details of the facts and circumstances which are at the centre of the dispute. In that exercise, I propose to refer to the servants as plaintiffs and the master as the defendant or defendants.  And so I proceed now to what I consider the relevant facts. The defendants herein, the Volta Aluminium Co. are a limited liability company operating in Tema and relying extensively on electricity generated by the Volta River Authority for smelting alumina into aluminium. The plaintiffs are employees of the defendants who are popularly referred to as Valco. Their conditions of employment are spelt out in a collective agreement with Valco entered into on their behalf by their mother union, the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union (I.C.U.), in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299). The proximate facts leading to the instant litigation arose because the low level of water in the Volta lake following the severe droughts in the country in 1982 led to a fall in the electricity supply in the whole country. In the circumstances the defendants averred that the electricity suppliers, the Volta River Authority, by reducing their supply in order to conserve electricity compelled them in or about the first week of October 1982 to close down two out of their five pot-lines by 1 November 1982. This meant a 40 per cent loss of income to the defendants and a reduction in their aluminium production. The situation saddled the defendant-company with an excess labour force and compelled them in the last few weeks before 18 October 1982 to deliberate on ways and means of shedding their excess labour force if the company were to survive. Under the pressure of these events, the company apparently requested a meeting with the local union and representatives of the Valco Workers Defence Committee at their conference room on 18 October 1982 and put forward before them a six-point proposal to solve the problem of, as the company put it, ""the excess employees that the company would not have jobs for as a result of . . . the 40 per cent cut back in \[p.348\] production capacity."" The company's six-point proposals are as follows:  �1. Valco agrees to loan to these employees an amount of money equal to 200 per cent of their monthly base pay for each completed year of service.  2\. Place each of these employees on leave of absence from 1 November 1982.  3\. During the period, these employees will be encouraged to use the loan for farming or other profitable ventures in the national interest.  4\. Employees on leave of absence will be given first opportunity for re-employment at Valco. Re-employment opportunity will be based on Valco's ability to return to production and article 14 (b) of the 1980-83 contract between Valco and I.C.U..  5\. Re-employed employees will be required to repay the loan over five years at eight per cent interest beginning from the date of re-employment and continue to accumulate services less the period of leave of absence.  6\. If Valco is not able to re-employ these employees by 1 January 1984, they will be considered redundant effective from 1 November 1982 and the loan amount converted to redundancy payment in accordance with article 40 (d) of the 1980-83 agreement between Valco and I.C.U..""  On the basis of these proposals, the tripartite group of the Valco management, the representatives of the local union and representatives of the Valco Workers Defence Committee agreed on 29 October 1982 to an arrangement described as ""Valco leave of absence without pay/recall programme."" The programme was worked out at four meetings of the tripartite group held on 18, 19, 28 and 29 October 1982, respectively. This programme L.O.A. as it has been called in these proceedings which the Valco management considered to be very generous and beneficial to the employees and which all the employees accepted rather than face immediate redundancy under the collective agreement process, has been trenchantly condemned by the plaintiffs.  On their behalf it was urged before us that the L.O.A. programme was an ingenious device motivated by the desire to circumvent the provisions of the collective agreement relating to redundancy and was calculated to give Valco a free hand in selecting for redundancy employees they considered undesirable. It was also bluntly argued before us, that the stark motive of Valco was to avoid paying a higher terminal benefit which was soon to fall due under an impending \[p.349\] collective agreement by which an employee's terminal benefit would be calculated by reference to a multiplier of 700 per cent as against 200 per cent under the then substituting collective agreement. It is the submission proceeds, for these reasons that Valco cleverly attempted to abrogate and indeed purported to substitute a new employment contract, for the collective agreement.  On behalf of the plaintiffs, bad faith was furthermore attributed to Valco and Valco's bona fides was questioned. I have no doubt, speaking for myself, that Valco's proposals were calculated to ameliorate the traumatic effect of the redundancy forced on them by the power cut and to minimise its effect on their employees; but in the law of contract, the motive for entering into a contract is, as a general proposition, quite irrelevant as far as its validity is concerned and for this reason, I do not think it is necessary for us to make any pronouncement as to whether these charges against Valco are true or false, nor do I think we should react to these acrimonious fulminations even if they are true. The document containing the L.O.A. programme was tendered in evidence and because, motive or no motive, it is the essential material upon which the litigation is founded, I consider the setting down herein of all its provisions to be very necessary indeed. Under the programme, it is provided as follows:  ""For the excess employees that will not have jobs as a result of the shut down of two pot lines:  1\. Valco agrees to loan to these employees an amount of money equal to 200 per cent of their monthly base pay for each completed year of service less outstanding financial obligations to the company. The initial payment will be considered an advance against their farm loan or redundancy payment.  (a) Employees will have the option to convert the advance to redundancy anytime between 1 November 1982 and 31 December 1982.  (b) If the employee does not return to the plant to sign the necessary documents for the farm loan scheme by 31 December 1982, he will be considered to have taken the redundancy option and to be declared redundant accordingly.  (c) Subject to obtaining necessary approval, an employee on this programme at one time can convert up to �1,500 of his loan amount to purchase the following equipment:  fertilizer chain saw  fence wire outboard motor  \[p.350\]  roofing sheet fishing net  cement mechanised and electrical tools  poultry food portable welding machine  portable water pump water hose.  The duty and shipping cost to be borne by the employee. Employees to exercise this option by 31 December 1982.  (d) Employees recalled will be required to repay the loan at one per cent interest over five years beginning from the date of recall and continue to accumulate service less the period of leave of absence.  2 Benefits that employees on leave of absence will receive are subject to Valco's continued operations.  (a) 10/12 of the 1982 bonus or if employed less than one year a pro rata amount.  (b) Employees on leave of absence will be eligible to purchase the November food package and December supplementary food package, in addition to receiving the December 1982 free food package. Employees will be eligible to purchase one food package every quarter (March, June, September and December of 1983).  (c) Employees will be eligible to receive the cloth for December 1982.  (d) Hospital benefits for employees on leave of absence and dependants will be continued until December 1983, provided during this period the employee is pursuing projects for which the loan was granted and have not secured job with another employer. There will be no additional dependants added during this period except for new born babies of registered wives as of 31 October 1982.  (e) Employees will be allowed to convert their incentive points as of 31 October 1982 for V.I.P. goods or convert them to cash by 31 December 1982.  (f) Affected employees' children under Valco scholarship will continue to enjoy the award until the award's period is exhausted. However the determining factor should be the child's academic capability.  3 . Employees will be placed on leave of absence from 1 November 1982.  (a) Affected employees with less than one year service will be given two months base pay.  (b) Employees on leave of absence will be given first opportunity for recall to Valco. Recall opportunity will be based on Valco's ability to return to production.  \[p.351\]  4\. If Valco is not able to recall these employees by 1 January 1984, they will be considered redundant effective from 1 November 1982, and the loan amount converted to redundancy payment in accordance with article 40 (d) of the 1980-83 agreement between Valco and I.C.U.  5\. In the event of the death of an employee on leave of absence, the company shall donate �2,000 to his previously designated beneficiary to assist the bereaved family in meeting the funeral expenses. The company shall bear the cost of mortuary bill for up to two (2) weeks period. In addition the company shall provide a pick up to convey the deceased from Valco Hospital to his hometown in Ghana.""  As at the date, 29 October 1982, when this scheme for laying off some of Valco's employees was devised, the record of proceedings would seem to indicate that no one outside management apparently knew precisely the identities of all the employees to be affected by the exercise. However, on 1 November 1982 the employees who reported for work were given pieces of paper on which was written that they should check their names on the notice board and any person whose name appeared there should not report at the plant or his usual office. The pieces of paper were headed ""special notice to all regular employees"" and the notice dated Sunday 31 October 1982 reads:  ""Names of employees on the leave of absence without pay/recall programmes are posted by badge Nos on special bulletin board at the Palm Court.  All employees reporting for work to check the posting. If your name is on the list please proceed to the pay booth to collect your entitlement and relevant documents pertaining to the programme. Please review the instruction sheet contained in your envelope.""  The envelope given to the affected employee contained a letter, and that letter it would seem was the first hint which all the affected plaintiffs who attended work on 1 November 1982 had, that they were being declared redundant with immediate effect. I reproduce the letter hereunder for its effect to be appreciated. It is as follows:  ""Dear employee,  As you may be aware, the Volta River Authority (V.R.A.) has notified Valco that there is a shortage of water in the Volta Lake. Due to this shortage, the V.R.A. has declared a force majeure effective 1 November 1982, under the power contract with Valco. This means that V.R.A. must reduce the power available to \[p.352\] Valco and requires us to shut down two of our five pot lines on 1 November.  As a result of the power curtailment a number of our employees are in excess of our needs and must be placed on leave of absence. I regret to have to inform you that you are one of the people who have to be placed on leave of absence.  The details of the leave of absence are described in the leave of absence without pay/recall programme, a copy of which is enclosed. This programme was jointly worked out with the Workers' Defence Committee (W.D.C.) and the local union. Briefly our objective was to try to minimise the effect on you, while providing you with the opportunity to be recalled.  I wish you every success in your new venture.  Yours sincerely,  (Sgd.) H. Goulter  Works Manager.""  Included in the envelope is an instruction sheet, it is perhaps worth noting its contents and I also reproduce it hereunder:  ""Instruction Sheet  1\. You are welcome to keep the safety equipment (shoes, pants, shirts, safety glasses and hat) that you have in your possession or in your locket.  2\. An IR-8 is enclosed explaining the calculation of the advance check which is enclosed.  3\. You can return any time after 8 November to collect your final pay check.  4\. When you return to collect your final pay check, you can make your choice of award under the Valco incentive programme or secure the cash equivalent.  5\. A blank loan agreement is enclosed. You should read this later and bring it back to the personnel office to execute by 31 December 1982. You may want to sign the loan agreement when you pick up your final check.  6\. Be sure and leave your current address with the personnel office. If your address changes during your leave of absence, notify the personnel office.""  And so it came to pass that on 1 November 1982 a first batch of Valco employees included in the 463 plaintiffs herein were shut out of the plant, workshop and offices of their employer compulsorily and were offered an attenuated redundancy under the collective agreement or the qualified and abnormal redundancy under the L.O.A. programme.  \[p.353\]  On 7 February and 16 November 1983, with no preliminary negotiations with any entity whatsoever, Valco repeated the exercise by notifying a second and third batches of employees of their inclusion in the L.O.A. programme. The general notice to the third batch, to be referred to later in this judgment dated 16 November 1983 requested them to go home on that date and return to the plant on or after Tuesday 22 November to collect their entitlement. The appointments of the third batch therefore, were clearly purportedly terminated on 16 November 1983.  Valco has maintained in these proceedings that it gave the employees it sent home a choice of being declared redundant under the collective agreement, or becoming redundant under the L.O.A. It seems to me that on the facts led in evidence that contention is clearly untenable. Redundancy under the collective agreement as I hope to demonstrate later in this opinion, is preceded by agreed procedural steps. The redundancy the employees were subjected to however was instant redundancy albeit a dismissal completely outside the collective agreement. The proffered so-called choice is to be exercised within two months later, after a fait accompli, when the employee had in fact already been declared redundant and paid some of his entitlement. A choice given after the event is no choice.  It would seem also that the L.O.A. agreement was specifically devised for the first batch of employees sent home on 1 November 1982. In the very first instance of the L.O.A. document it is stated that the programme was ""For the excess of employees that will not have jobs as a result of the shut down of two pot lines."" Other provisions in the document overwhelmingly confirmed this. Consider the fact that under paragraph 1 (a) of the L.O.A. as worked out by the tripartite group the option ""to convert the advance to redundancy"", whatever that meant, is restricted to the period from 1 November to 31 December 1982. Furthermore, under paragraph 1 (b) it is only in cases where the employee did not return to the plant by 31 December 1982 to sign the L.O.A. document that he was declared redundant. Moreover under paragraph 4, in case Valco was unable to recall the redundant employees by 1 January 1984, they were to be considered redundant with effect from 1 November 1982. And in any case, at the tripartite negotiations provision was not made reserving to Valco the right to apply the L.O.A. to subsequent dismissals or future declarations of redundancy.  Faced with the apparently inadvertent or unanticipated contingency in the events that occurred, when other pot-lines were closed down, Valco unilaterally amended the L.O.A. programme mutatis mutandis to apply to the second and third batches of employees which it also slated for redundancy. In the case of the second batch sent \[p.354\] away on 7 February 1983 the relevant amendment reads, inter alia, ""if Valco is not able to recall these employees by 6 February 1984, they will be considered redundant effective 7 February 1983 . . ."" With regard to the third batch, the notice posted on the premises dated 16 November 1986 reads:  ""Names of employees on leave of absence without pay-recall programme are posted by badge numbers on special bulletin boards at the parking lot.  All employees reporting for work today 16 November 1983 should check the positing. If your name is on the list, please go home and return to the plant on or after Tuesday 22 November 1983 to collect your entitlement and relevant documents relating to the programme.  If you have any questions on your mind please contact Nee Amartey in the personnel building.""  In the light of this it is not unreasonable even in the absence of the amended L.O.A. covering the third batch to make an intelligent assumption that the relevant amendment in their case reads mutatis mutatis as follows: ""If Valco is not able to recall these employees by 15 November 1984 they will be considered redundant effective from 16 November 1983 . . .""  Be that as it may, on 19 June 1987 the plaintiffs in the three batches numbering 463 commenced this action by the issue of a writ of summons against their employer Valco. They claim:  ""(1) Damages for wrongful termination of employment.  (2) Declaration that the purported termination of their employment is null and void, is of no legal effect and ought to be vacated.  (3) Arrears of all salary, all allowances and all benefits due to the plaintiffs from their respective dates of wrongful termination to date of judgment.""  I must remark that the strategy of the 463 plaintiffs, a truly impressive number of persons taking a joint action against the defendant-company, is unfortunate and certainly not realistic. Admittedly, the vaunted justification for doing this is reflected in the first paragraph of the statement of claim in which it was averred that: ""The plaintiffs have a common grievance and common cause of action in which they agitate common grounds in law and in fact against the defendant-company."" But an examination of the evidence led, though supportive of common ground in law, reveals a variety of facts, circumstances and unexamined facts that may affect the nature of damages recoverable by a successful plaintiff. For instance in \[p.355\] paragraph 22 of the defendant's pleadings, a defence admittedly vague was put forward ""that some of the plaintiffs have been re-engaged, some others have found employment elsewhere while one had died."" These persons were not specified, but I apprehend that if they had purported to give evidence, cross-examination would have revealed the nature of the measure of damages applicable to them, if they were successful.  In the present case when the practical difficulty engendered by such a large number of persons pursuing a common claim became clear, counsel accommodated themselves by consenting to the following procedure:  ""The court should deal with only the issues as to whether or not they were rightly terminated, as well as their entitlements. The detailed benefits will be determined later. It is also agreed that the evidence given by the witness on the conditions of employment and the exhibits tendered apply to all the plaintiffs. It is agreed also that the witnesses may be recalled for further cross-examination.�  In my opinion this last minute attempt to rationalise the procedure adopted is not satisfactory. In fact both counsel and the court appeared to have forgotten this reservation for the determination of the benefits. In the situation revealed here, the conventional approach of the legal profession, an approach sanctioned by generations of common law judges is the technique of mounting a test case with those plaintiffs who typify in their claims the interests sought to be protected. In the instant case, one or two plaintiffs selected from each of the three batches exemplifying the interests of persons declared redundant and laid off on 1 November 1983, 7 February 1983 and 16 November 1983 respectively plus one or two trainee-plaintiffs would have ensured a smooth trial capable of securing a definitive pronouncement of the interests of all the litigants. I am afraid, for reasons inexplicable and regretfully hard for me to fathom, the legal advisers of the plaintiffs did not use this time-honoured machinery of the well-known conventional practice in our procedure system. The unfortunate failure to do this carries the potential of a multiplicity of legal processes with the inevitable consequence that finality in litigation must of necessity elude the parties in the instant contest.  Be that as it may, the trial judge Benin J. after hearing six of the 463 plaintiffs and two witnesses for the defendant with one witness who gave evidence-in-chief both for the plaintiffs and the defendant-company, delivered judgment in which he held after a careful and anxious consideration of the evidence led by the parties, that most of \[p.356\] the plaintiffs were wrongfully dismissed by the defendant-company. There were also some plaintiffs, their number was not clearly identified, but in whose case some tendentious piece of evidence, with slight probative value, was belatedly offered by the defendants in an attempt to show that they were not employees and were consequently not covered by the collective agreement. The judge accepted that position and accordingly dismissed their claim.  With regard to the successful plaintiffs the judge held that they were entitled to damages for wrongful dismissal as set out in the first claim. The judge however held that the second claim seeking a declaration that the termination of their employment was null and void and of no legal effect, ""does not avail the plaintiffs"" and he therefore declined to make the declaration.  With regard to damages, he awarded each of the successful plaintiffs a total sum covered by 26 months of his salary as compensation for the wrongful termination of his employment plus questionable two months' salary in lieu of notice making a total award of 28 months salary. In arriving at this figure of 28 months, he took note of the fact that in the termination notice of 31 October 1982, the affected plaintiffs, clearly of the first batch, were asked to stay at home, until 1 January 1984. From 31 October 1982 to 1 January 1984 is a period of 14 months and as he thought on the date of the purported termination they were entitled to two months notice he also awarded two months salary as compensation in lieu of notice making the award to cover sixteen months. He also thought that in determining the measure of the damages which the said plaintiffs were entitled to, he must take account of a reasonable period during which they were to look for employment and he decided for stated reasons that twelve months was appropriate and he also gave a further twelve months' salary, thus he awarded for damages 28 months' salary for the first claim. With regard to the third claim he held that the wrongfully dismissed plaintiffs were entitled to: ""earned leave allowance, bonus, long service awards and end of service benefits as at the date each of them was laid off �provided these were earned, but had not already been paid to them. He excluded claims for food package and other claims founded on what the plaintiffs called gentleman agreement and which they contended they would have been entitled to if they had not been dismissed. All these payments he held are to be made to the plaintiffs less the farm loan taken by each of them under the L.O.A. programme. He awarded costs of �50,000 in favour of the plaintiffs against Valco.  From this judgment of Benin J. the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal. Their complaint was in respect of five matters which they itemised as follows:  \[p.357\]  (1) The decision that the trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees;  (2) the decision that the termination of the respective appointments of the plaintiffs were only wrongful and not void;  (3) the decision that food packages did not form part of the plaintiffs' enforceable conditions of service;  (4) the restriction of the compensation to twelve months; and  (5) inadequate and unreasonable awards.  The defendants also appealed against the whole decision with the exception of (a) the judge's decision in regard to the trainees; (b) his decision rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void; and (c), his holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to food package and other benefits said to be due to them on a gentleman's agreement basis.  At the Court of Appeal, by a unanimous decision (see Nartey-Tokoli v. Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. \[1987-88\] 2 G.L.R. 532, C.A.) the High Court holding that the defendants were liable to the plaintiffs for wrongful termination of their employment was confirmed and the High Court judge's refusal to declare the termination as null and void was affirmed. The dismissal of the claim of the trainee plaintiffs by the High Court was also upheld. With regard to the damages, a majority of two to one held that apart from the two months' salary in lieu of notice awarded as compensation, a reasonable sum which they fixed at four months' salary as at 31 December 1983, was a measure of the successful plaintiffs' entitlement and they therefore ordered as follows at 000:  ""The parties are hereby ordered to appear before the court below to calculate how much is due to each of the successful plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from date of termination to 31 December 1983 and all other entitlements such as earned leave allowance, bonus, long service awards and end of service benefits as at the date each of them was laid off as provided for under the collective agreement . . . These to be determined as at 31 December 1983.  (b) Four months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (c) Two months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (d) Their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement.""  It is from this judgment that the plaintiffs and defendants have each appealed to this court. Having regard to the fact that all the learned judges who had been exposed to the facts without a single exception had no difficulty at all in deciding the issue of liability, \[p.358\] clearly a question of fact, in favour of the plaintiffs, I would have expected that the defendants could have had appropriate advice and be persuaded to abandon the contest on this issue. I would have thought that the principle so mandatorily introduced into our law on 26 October 1987 by the provision of section 3 (2) of the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372) as inserted by the Courts (Amendment) Law, 1987 (P.N.D.C.L. 191) should have discouraged the defendants from proceeding further with their attack on the issue of liability. Surely the decision of this Supreme Court in Bimpong v. The Republic \[1989-90\] 2 G.L.R. 252, S.C ante and our unanimous decision in In re Krah (Decd); Yankyeraah v. Osei-Tutu \[1989-90\] 1 G.L.R. 638, S.C. do inhibit a successful decision in favour of the defendant-company on the issue of liability. Be that as it may, I do not wish to avoid a legal determination of the issue by pre-emoting the reasoning which sustains the liability of Valco for the wrongful dismissal of its employees. I propose therefore to examine the issue of liability seeing that the defendants have severely criticised the unanimous decision of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal that they are liable in damages to the plaintiffs for wrongfully terminating their employment.  The plaintiffs were members of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union of the T.U.C., known for short as I.C.U.. It is a trade union which has been certified and empowered under sections 3 and 6 of Act 299 as the appropriate representative to conduct on behalf of Valco employees collective bargaining with Valco touching, inter alia, the terms and conditions of employment and non-employment and conditions of labour which shall apply to all employees of the company for whom the union has been certified to negotiate. The union in the exercise of the statutory power thus given to it by Act 299, negotiated a collective agreement with Valco on 1 March 1980. This agreement was tendered in the proceedings as exhibit A. In view of submissions which counsel for the defendants has seen fit to make to this court, I set hereunder the preamble to the agreement. It reads:  ""This agreement made this 1 day of March 1980 between the Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. (Valco) (hereinafter referred to as the company) and the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union of T.U.C. of Ghana officially certified under the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the Union) as the negotiating body, provides for the terms and conditions of employment and non-employment and the conditions of labour which shall apply to all employees of the said company for whom the Union has been certified to negotiate.""  Counsel for Valco quoting Hepple and O�Higgins, Employment Law (3rd ed.) at p. 15 made reference to articles 3 (e), 7, 17, 27 and 30 of the \[p.359\] collective agreement and submitted that ""Union"" appearing in these articles of the collective agreement must by a process of interpretation which I have not succeeded in following, be taken to mean the Valco local union having regard to the concept of ""official"" in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, 1974 of England. He was in the circumstance critical of the view of the Court of Appeal that ""Union"" appearing in the collective agreement, must be the I.C.U. having regard to the fact that wherever the local union is intended as in articles 8 (d) and 9, the collective agreement specifically says so.  It seems to me with respect that the argument of counsel for Valco is very sterile, far-fetched and unrealistic. Where the preamble has specifically indicated what is meant by ""Union"" as it appeared in the contract document, exhibit A, I am unable to understand the relevance of these foreign authorities within the context of counsel's argument. Take his argument in respect of article 17 which provides:  ""Payment of salaries and wages shall be made semi-monthly. However by mutual agreement between the company and the union, the pay day can be changed to suit both parties.""  Counsel argues that ""Union in this context cannot possibly be meant to be the national executive of the I.C.U.."" But why not, having regard to the meaning of union in the preamble? I think the argument is demonstrably fallacious and unacceptable. Admittedly in the context of a particular article the use of ""Union"" may mean Valco local union or the I.C.U., but this is a far cry from a contention that under the collective agreement, the local union has the same powers as the I.C.U, with the authority which the I.C.U. has by statute to negotiate for the employees with the employers. The argument does not impress me and I reject it. I reject it because nowhere in the collective agreement is the local union given power to negotiate for the Valco employees, even if by a process of reasoning, it can be said that the I.C.U. could delegate their powers to the local union. Indeed, the power of the I.C.U. to negotiate for Valco employees which is conceded in the preamble is enshrined in sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 of Act 299.  The inevitable conclusion to be derived from considering the relevant provisions of Act 299 in relation to the L.O.A. is that those who entered into it had no legal capacity to negotiate any employment terms or redundancy conditions for Valco and its employees. In the circumstances the L.O.A. as a contract between Valco and its employees is contrary to Act 299 and is accordingly null and void and of no legal effect as far as the provisions of the collective agreement are concerned. Consider the participation of the workers defence committee. This is a body popularly known as one of the revolutionary organs in the body politic. It surfaced after the traumatic events of \[p.360\] 31 December 1981, but it is an entity with ill-defined functions whose legal status is unknown to Act 299. It had no lawful business with the legal relations subsisting between Valco and its employees. In view of Act 299 its participation in the so-called L.O.A. programme as well as the involvement of the Valco local union is vacuous and has no legal consequence whatsoever.  Counsel for Valco also put forward an alternative argument in a bid to save the L.O.A. programme from collapsing. I set down the ipsissima verba of his submission hereunder in order to enable its effect and implication to be fully appreciated. It was in this form:  ""The difference between the legal effect of a collective agreement like exhibit A and the L.O.A. programme as settled by the union/W.D.C. and Valco is as follows: Exhibit A became applicable to an employee from the moment he was employed. But the L.O.A. programme did not become automatically applicable from the moment an employee was declared redundant. It became applicable only when the employee chose it in preference to the redundancy provisions under exhibit A; and he had full two months in which to exercise his option by completing and signing the loan agreement exhibit C4. An employee who did not return the loan agreement duly completed and signed within the period was presumed to have opted for redundancy entitlements under the collective agreement.""  It is surprising that such a glaringly fallacious argument contrary to the provisions of a statute could be made to the highest court in the land. This in effect is an argument conceding a power in the Valco employees to waive the rights given them under the collective agreement for new rights under the L.O.A. programme. It seems to me that sections 10 (2) and (4) of Act 299 specifically and mandatorily deny such a right to employees covered by a collective agreement. The relevant provisions are as follows:  ""10. (2) The provisions of a collective agreement under this Act concerning terms of employment and termination of employment, and personal obligations imposed on, and rights granted to, an employee or employer shall be regarded as terms of a contract of employment between each employee to whom the provision applies and his employer.  (4) The rights conferred on an employee by a collective agreement under this Act shall be rights which cannot be waived by the employee and, if there is any conflict between a term of a collective agreement under this Act and the terms of any contract not contained in such a collective agreement, then the \[p.361\] collective agreement shall prevail, whether or not the contract was concluded before the collective agreement.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  In a valiant and robust attempt to prevail on this court to uphold the validity of the L.O.A. agreement, counsel went to great lengths by citing a number of English cases, namely Edwards v. Skyways Ltd. \[1964\] 1 All E.R. 494; Barnes v. Richards (1902) 46 S.J. 298; and a dictum of Lord Radcliffe in I.C.I. Ltd v. Shatwell \[1964\] 2 All E.R. 999. These cases were quoted in an argument calculated to demonstrate to us that the loan agreement was a consensual one and was offered as an alternative redundancy arrangement, which should be considered valid and lawful because it was more beneficial to the employees than the redundancy provisions under the collective agreement. Furthermore, it was argued that the employees had a clear choice to accept or reject it.  The argument that the L.O.A. is more beneficial to the employees has been pressed ad nauseam before all the lower courts. It looks superficially attractive but it does not convince or impress me. Consider its implication: The sum of money which the employee is by law entitled to be given without any strings attached was offered to him as a loan. The manner in which he was to use the proffered loan was dictated to him by his employer. The loan, apparently his own money, is to attract interest. I do not see how any one can consider this to be more attractive than the payment which leaves the recipient free to do what he likes with his own money. Surely this so-called beneficial argument ignores the mandatory provision of section 10 (4) of Act 299 and it is contrary to the terms of the very first article of the collective agreement under Act 299 which is as follows:  ""No employee covered by this agreement shall be compelled or allowed to enter into a contract or agreement with the company concerning the conditions of employment, wages and salaries as dealt with in this agreement or shall be allowed to be bonded to the company without prior discussion with the union.""  I have no doubt that when the legislature in its own wisdom has devised a mandatory and imperative provision for the protection of an employee or any person, an argument that the provisions can be lawfully ignored and another provision said to be beneficial to the employee or person substituted at the discretion of the court or any person is one that a common law judge ought not to countenance. It is an invidious and dangerous argument subversive of the legal order. It is an invitation to ignore Act 299 and must necessarily be misconceived. Lord Loreburn L.C. in, Attorney-General v. Birmingham, Tame \[p.362\] and Rea District Drainage Board \[1912\] A.C. 788 at 795, H.L. expressed the collective view of common law judges when he said that: ""\[a\] court of law has no power to grant a dispensation from obedience to an Act of Parliament.""  Counsel for Valco quoted a number of foreign and local cases and submitted in effect that by their ratios Valco was not in breach of the redundancy provisions of the collective agreement. The redundancy provisions are in article 14 and they are as follows""  ""(a) In the event of redundancy, the company shall notify the Union as far in advance as practicable.  (b) The criteria for determining employees to be redundant shall be based on merit, potential skill, physical and mental ability to assume other jobs and good conduct. All things being equal length of service shall be the determinant factor.  (c) When subsequent employment arises, in the same department within three (3) months from the date employees in that department were declared redundant, these employees will be given preference for re-employment. It is understood that any redundant employee re-hired under this article shall be considered a new employee.  (d) Where the company wishes to retain the services of the less senior man because of his merit, ability or skill, regardless of his length of service, the union will be informed accordingly.  (e) Employees to be declared redundant will be given two (2) months' notice or paid in lieu.""  Under article 14 (a), clearly the I.C.U. should have been notified of the intended redundancy exercise which Valco had, a few weeks before 18 October 1982, decided to mount. The I.C.U. as a representative body will have the obligation to pass the information to the affected employees on whose behalf it has been given statutory responsibility to act. In my well-considered opinion, in the interest of fair industrial relations, notification must involve submitting to the union as far in advance as possible the names of the employees to be affected. That way the employee to be declared redundant is enabled to take advantage of the beneficial provisions of articles 14 (b) and 11 (d) if he considers that they have been breached or are likely to be breached in his case. It is a serious matter certainly riot conducive to industrial peace, where the machinery which the legislature has carefully devised to give fair hearing to employees and to promote harmony between the employee and the employer is unilaterally \[p.363\] ignored by the employer in blatant disregard of the rules of natural justice enshrined in the audi alteram partem principle.  It seems to me that all the plaintiffs herein were so suddenly locked out of their place of employment that they had no opportunity to avail themselves of the protection given to them under articles 14 (b) and 11 (d) of the collective agreement. Furthermore, the right reserved to the union to be informed, under article 14 (a) was crudely disregarded, thus disabling the union from carrying out its obligations under the collective agreement. Article 14 (e) was also breached since the employees were not given two months notice or payment in lieu. In the circumstances to quote legal authorities, none of which binds us, and to urge us to hold on the strength of their questionable and hardly relevant reasoning that there was no breach of the collective agreement, and we should thus set aside the contrary finding in the decision of every judge in the High Court and the Court of Appeal who have had the occasion to consider the matter, is an emotional invitation to us to ignore indisputable facts which do not support the defendants' case. Such an argument is with respect romancing and does not certainly reflect serious advocacy in this appellate court of last resort. I reject this unfortunate argument. In my view, the High Court and the Court of Appeal came to the right decision when they took the view that on the evidence Valco was in breach of the provisions of the collective agreement and had acted contrary to the provisions of Act 299. In my view, the specific provisions of Act 299 breached are sections 5, 6, 7 and 10.  I have now concluded my opinion on the issue of the defendants' liability, but before I am finally done, I must say, speaking for myself, that I am really amazed at how a respectable and apparently efficient organisation like Valco, which had no doubt access to appropriate advice can be so careless in formulating in so unlawful a manner a major and sensitive administration programme involving its commercial and labour interests. The draftsman of the L.O.A. by making reference to the collective agreement demonstrated that he was aware of its existence and its contents. A most casual and superficial examination of that document by any responsible officer with even no pretension of knowledge of law at all will show that the L.O.A. is in conflict with the collective agreement and can therefore hardly be a legal document.  I now move to consider two other matters before I finally deal with the question of damages. The High Court and the Court of Appeal were unable to grant the declaration in the second claim requested by the plaintiffs that the purported termination of their employment is null and void, is of no legal effect and ought to be vacated. The defendants have argued that this decision is right, the \[p.364\] plaintiffs disputed it. I have already given in considerable details the background to the termination of the plaintiffs' employment and on the strength of the indisputable facts accepted by the lower courts, the matter can be resolved by applying the law of master and servant as it is understood under the common law. In a consideration of this matter I think some pertinent observations of Lord Reid in Ridge v. Baldwin \[1964\] A.C. 40 at 65, H.L. offer tremendous help. Speaking generally of dismissals he said:  ""These \[dismissals\] appear to fall into three classes: dismissal of a servant by his master, dismissal from an office held during pleasure, and dismissal from an office where there must be something against a man to warrant his dismissal.  The law regarding master and servant is not in doubt. There cannot be specific performance of a contract of service, and the master can terminate the contract with the servant at any time and for any reason or for none. But if he does so in a manner not warranted by the contract he must pay damages for breach of contract. So the question in a pure case of master and servant does not at all depend on whether the master has heard the servant in his own defence: it depends on whether the facts emerging at the trial prove breach of contract. But this kind of case can resemble dismissal from an office where the body employing the man is under some statutory or other restriction as to the kind of contract which it can make with its servants, or the grounds on which it can dismiss them.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  The common law position in what Lord Wilberforce described as pure master and servant cases"" was stated succinctly by Lord Reid in Malloch v. Aberdeen Corporation \[1971\] 1 W.L.R. 1578 at 1581, H.L. where he said:  ""At common law a master is not bound to hear his servant before he dismisses him. He can act unreasonably or capriciously if he so chooses but the dismissal is valid. The servant has no remedy unless the dismissal is in breach of contract and then the servant's only remedy is damages for breach of contract.""  Apparently under the common law, in a pure master and servant situation, the audi alterem partem principle of the rules of natural justice does not apply; and it would seem that it is a reaction to the effect of that on the development of the modern law of master and servant that led Lord Wilberforce in the Malloch v. Aberdeen case (supra) at 1595-1596 to define the limits of the common law remedy. He said:  \[p.365\]  ""One may accept that if there are relationships in which all requirements of the observance of rules of natural justice are excluded (and I do not wish to assume that this is inevitably so), these must be confined to what have been called 'pure master and servant cases,' which I take to mean cases in which there is no element of public employment or service, no support by statute, nothing in the nature of an office or a status which is capable of protection. If any of these elements exist, then, in my opinion, whatever the terminology used, and even though in some inter parties aspects the relationship may be called that of master and servant, there may be essential procedural requirements to be observed, and failure to observe them may result in a dismissal being declared to be void.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  It seems to me that this view of Lord Wilberforce is authority albeit persuasive, for the proposition that where by the agreement of parties, there is a formal contract of employment spelling out clearly the terms of the procedural steps to be taken by the parties for the purpose of termination, then legally neither party can properly terminate such a contract of employment by a unilateral act in blatant violation of the terms of the agreement: see the Australian case of Authomatic Fire Sprinklers Proprietary Ltd. v. Watson \[1946\] 72 C.L.R. 435. In that case Lathan C.J. at 457 put the principle this way:  "". . . one party to a contract cannot by a wrongful unilateral act bring the contract to an end. If an employer wrongfully dismisses a servant, he breaks but does not terminate the contract . . .""  By this formulation a clear distinction is drawn between breach of contract and termination of contract, its implication being that a breach of contract does not necessarily result in its termination. In the light of this it is necessary to canvass how the courts operate the remedy by way of declaration in appropriate cases when such breaches occur. Woolf J. in R v. B.B.C., Ex parte Lavelle \[1983\] 1 W.L.R. 23 at 35-36 discussed and considered the matter and said:  ""In this case it seems clear to me that . . . there was a restriction as to the circumstances in which she could be dismissed. Although the restriction was largely procedural, . . . it did alter her rights substantially from what they would have been at common law. In my view, this had the consequence of making her contract of employment different from those referred to by Lord Reid where in the past the sole remedy was one of \[p.366\] damages. I have therefore come to the conclusion that in appropriate circumstances, in the case of employment of the nature here being considered, the court can if necessary intervene by way of injunction, and certainly by way of declaration.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  This decision of Woolf J. was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in \[1983\] 1 W.L.R. 1302. Its ratio is in consonance with the opinion of Buckley L.J. reading the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Stevenson v. United Road Transport Union (1977) I.C.R. 893 at 906 where quoting the case of Durayappah v. Fernando \[1967\] 2 A.C. 337 at 354, P.C. he said:  �... if the decision is challenged by the person aggrieved on the grounds that the principle has not been obeyed, he is entitled to claim that as against him it \[the dismissal\] is void ab initio and has never been of any effect.""  In the case which gave rise to this opinion of Buckley L.J. the executive committee of the union with power to dismiss under certain conditions exercised its power of dismissal when the conditions had not been satisfied. The case would on principle seem to be on all fours with the instant case. The court granted a declaration that the dismissal was, inter alia, null and void. Our own local law is not waiting in dicta and precedent on this question. In Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh \[1984-86\] I G.L.R. 122 at 129, C.A. Apaloo C.J. pointed out that:  ""\[T\]he normal remedy open to a servant who was dismissed or removed in breach of his contract of service, is pecuniary damages. This is because of the confidential nature of the relationship. But this is not an inflexible rule. There have been cases in which a purported removal of a servant from office was held to be a nullity. Mainly those are cases in which irrespective of the terms of the contract of employment the determination of the contract is regulated by legislation.""  The authorities show as Warner J. said in Irani v. Southampton and South West Hampshire Health Authority (1985) ICR 318, ""that damages at common law for wrongful dismissal are not generous"", and in my view, it would have been surprising if the common law had remained ossified and had not undergone the inevitable changes associated with virile organisms seeing that its remedy by way of damages is inadequate to meet the demands of any dynamic modern society.  \[p.367\]  In the instant case, Valco in purporting to declare redundancy did not follow the procedural machinery set up under the collective agreement for that purpose. By the modern law governing the master and servant relationship its action was ultra vires the collective agreement. It would seem therefore that by the provision of section 10 of Act 299, the so-called redundancy worked out by the L.O.A. is null and void and of no effect. The inevitable legal consequence is that the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration in terms of their second claim and I hold therefore that the purported termination of their employment is null and void, and is of no effect and should be accordingly vacated. I would in the circumstances allow the appeal of the plaintiffs against the decision of the Court of Appeal that the purported termination of their employment is not null and void and I would declare the terminations null and void and of no effect.  Before I deal with the issue of damages, I propose to deal with the case of the trainee plaintiffs. All the lower court judges were unanimous in holding that the trainees were not employees covered by the collective agreement. Their counsel however has sponsored their cause with commendable zeal in the best tradition of the legal profession. It is however with the greatest respect that I have regretfully come to the conclusion, after a close study of the record of proceedings, that the lower courts' decision in their case is erroneous in law and cannot with respect be supported.  The trainee plaintiffs were included among the 463 persons who sued Valco. To appreciate the nature of the case they made, it is necessary to consider the statement of their case and the admissions which Valco made touching their case. The relevant paragraph of the statement of claim of all the plaintiffs is as follows:  ""5. The terms and conditions of the plaintiffs' employment with the defendant-company were, at all material times, governed by a collective agreement made between the defendant-company and the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union of which all the plaintiffs are members.""  (The emphasis is mine.)  To this statement of claim, the defendants pleaded in defence in their paragraph 7: ""The defendants admit the averments contained in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim."" At the summons for directions the issues agreed to did not include any issue touching trainees. At the trial one of the employees, Quaye Tawiah, with badge No. 419 gave evidence and tendered the collective agreement, exhibit A. In his evidence he swore as follows: ""Exhibit A stipulates the conditions and terms of our employment and also the conditions under which we could be declared redundant."" He was not cross-examined at all on \[p.368\] this evidence nor was it suggested to him in his evidence that his claim that exhibit A applied to all the plaintiffs was false. On the contrary both counsel accepted a consent order of the court, inter alia, to the following effect: ""It is also agreed that the evidence given by the witness on the conditions of employment and the exhibits tendered apply to all the plaintiffs."" (The emphasis is mine.) With the consent of the court and the defence the plaintiffs closed their case on the issue of liability and left only entitlement to be determined later. The issue of trainees was never raised with this witness who gave evidence for all the plaintiffs and it was never raised with any other witness for the plaintiffs. Clearly, because the defendant-company had admitted in their defence that all the plaintiffs were employees of Valco, it was unnecessary for any of the plaintiffs or their witnesses to offer any other evidence on their status as employees of Valco. This is particularly so because not a single witness for the plaintiffs was cross-examined to remotely suggest that their standing as employees was being disputed. It was when the plaintiffs had closed their case and were misled by the defendants' admission to offer no evidence in connection with trainees that on the day the defence closed its case, its last witness gave evidence-in-chief as follows: ""We do have a training scheme and induct people into Valco. Trainees are trainees and are not employees of Valco.""  This volte face of the defendants was surprising and in cross-examination, the basis of the evidence was revealed: ""Q. What makes you think such trainees are not employees? A. The collective agreement states so clearly."" A scrupulous examination of the collective agreement, exhibit A, shows that it had no provisions whatsoever, which clearly or remotely or even vaguely deny the status of employees to trainees. Countless generations of common law judges have deplored the tactics which the defendants adopted in this case. In the House of Lords in Browne v. Dunn (1893) 6 R. 67, H.L. Lord Herschell L.C. deprecated the practice when he said:  �. . . It seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him . . . to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit . . . if you intend to impeach a witness you are bound, whilst he is in the box, to give him an opportunity of making any \[p.369\] explanation which is open to him ... that is not only a rule of professional practice in the conduct of a case, but is essential to fair play and fair dealing with witnesses.""  On the evidence on record the trainees are employees who were subject to the provisions of the collective agreement, the moment they joined Valco. They were treated in the exercise in the same way as the other employees of Valco; it is too late for Valco to repudiate their claim by a contention that they are not employees. I will therefore allow the appeal in their case and order that as the collective agreement also applied to them they were wrongfully dismissed and their dismissal is null and void and of no effect. It is true that in a letter, exhibit 3, to Timothy Sedoro, one of the trainees, it was stated that he was not covered by the collective agreement. Section 10 of Act 299 does not permit Valco to say so.  I now move to consider the last issue, namely the measure of damages and entitlements. With regard to wrongful termination of employment by an employer, the measure of damages stated in Employment Law (2nd ed.) by Hepple and O'Higgins at p. 528 is as follows:  ""The ordinary rule applies as regards the amount of compensation to which a wrongfully dismissed employee is entitled namely he is entitled to such money to cover his loss as arises naturally in the ordinary course of things from the breach and also for any loss which it was reasonably foreseeable by the parties as being likely to arise from the breach. This is normally lose of wages in the case of contract of employment.""  Also in the Law of Master and servant (1950 ed.) by Francis Raleigh Batt at p. 201 the author states:  ""The measure of damages in all actions for breach of contract is the same, namely the pecuniary loss sustained provided such loss flows naturally from the breach in question and this will be the case whenever the loss is such as any reasonable person knowing all the circumstances existing at the time of the breach which are known or ought to be known by the defendant would have contemplated as likely to result by the breach in question.""  This English formulation accords with the well-known proposition advanced by Alderson B. in Hadley v. Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch. 347 at 354: see also Hobbs v. London and South Western Rly (1875) L.R. 10 Q.B. 111. This orthodox school of thought advocating measuring the damages by wages or salary is typified in Lavarack v. Woods \[1967\] 1 Q.B. 278, C.A. In that case an employee under a five-year \[p.370\] contract with his employer was dismissed wrongfully in the third year of the contract. He was entitled under the contract to �4,000 per annum plus such bonus as the directors shall from time to time determine. It was held that he was entitled only to basic salary for the unexpired period of his contract and bonus up to the date of its abolition but not to the higher salary which reflected the bonus after the abolition.  There is however a second English school of thought exemplified in the case of Maw v. Jones (1890) 63 L.T. 347 in which the measure of damages awarded was not confined to the wages of the dismissed worker. See also Ellwood v. Liverpool Victoria Legal Friendly Soc. (1880) 42 L.T. 694. This line of decision has been criticised notably by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Addis v. Gramophone Co. Ltd. \[1909\] A.C. 488, H.L.. And in Austwick v. Midland Rly Co. Ltd. (1909) 25 T.L.R. 728 Grantham J. refused to follow Maw v. Jones (supra). However, in De Stempel v. Dunkels \[1938\] 1 All E.R. 238, C.A. heavy damages were given for procuring a breach of a contract of employment which was terminable on reasonable notice. This decision on close examination is clearly inconsistent with the principle enunciated in the decision of Grantham J. in Austwick v. Midland Rly Co. Ltd. (supra).  And so we arrive at a situation where two principles for measuring damages compete for acceptance in our jurisdiction. I think in the selection we must be guided by certain considerations. Section 61 of the Provisional National Defence Council (Establishment) Proclamation (Supplementary and Consequential Provisions) Law, 1982 (P.N.D.C.L. 42) enjoins us to apply all laws especially where they are derived from a foreign source in such a manner as they will be compatible with our national aspirations. Dr. Danquah in his introduction to his Cases on Akan Law pointed out at p. xxiii that ""the delicate feelings of the average African are not half as blunted as those of the average European."" A Ghanaian who has suffered a wrong expects redress and our law of wrongful dismissal should reflect it.  It seems to me that the Court of Appeal judges have already set the pace in a landmark decision and it will be a retrograde step to discourage and interfere with the progressive precedent they have set. I refer to Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh (supra). In that case Apaloo C.J. with whom Francois and Abban JJ.A. (as they then were) concurred, held in a case in which the plaintiffs had been wrongly retired, that it would be just and proper for the court to mark its disapproval of the plaintiffs' unconstitutional retirement by ordering that the defendant-board pay to each plaintiff an amount equal to two years' salary in addition to receiving their entitlements under their contract of employment. In Hemans v. Ghana National \[p.371\] Trading Corporation \[1978\] G.L.R. 4 at 10, C.A. Archer J.A. (as he then was) blazed the trial when he observed:  ""It seems to me that if the compensation for lawful termination is one month's pay after the employee had been fore-warned, then it should appear preposterous to award the same one month's salary where the termination � has been held to be unlawful.""  It follows from what I have said so far, that I consider that the alleged view in effect of Denman C.J. in Hartley v. Harman (1840) 3 E.R. 617 which was pressed on us that a stipulation as to a month's notice in a broken contract implied in all circumstances a month's wages as damages and no more cannot have survived in my respectful opinion the reasoning of Archer J.A. (as he then was) in the Hemans case (supra) as far as Ghana is concerned.  It follows from those authorities that I accept and adopt the reasoning of Apaloo C.J. in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh (supra) and I agree with the views of Archer J.A. (as he then was) in the Hemams case (supra). In the instant case, the trial High Court judge gave adequate reasons in the exercise of his discretion in awarding twelve months' salary as the measure of damages for each plaintiff. In the Agbettoh case (supra) two years' salary was awarded. I think the well-known practice in the conduct of appeals is that where a judge has used his discretion in arriving at a decision, then unless it can be demonstrated that he ignored the law or took into consideration facts that he ought to have excluded or omitted material facts which should have been considered, his conclusion should not be interfered with. Applying this principle, I am unable to appreciate the reasons why the twelve months' period chosen by Benin J. in the exercise of his discretion was set aside and I will therefore restore it.  I notice that although exhibits G and J showed plainly that the third batch were sent away on 16 November 1983, all the parties apparently inadvertently and for inexplicable reasons have fastened on 31 December 1983. 1 believe this is an error and should be corrected. Furthermore, apart from the first batch that were asked to go away for fourteen months, the second and third batches were asked to go away for twelve months. It follows from this that the effective dates of dismissals were the dates they were asked to expect to be recalled, but were not recalled, and the dates are for the three batches: 1 January 1984, 6 February 1984 and 15 November 1984 respectively. Although their dismissals are null and void, the legal position is as stated by Apaloo C.J. in Agbettoh's case (supra) at 131 where he said:  \[p.372\]  ""\[T\]o order that salaries be paid to them for \[all\] those years when they did not work for the board, albeit through no fault of their own, would be to set our face against realities. The reality of the situation is that although de jure they are still technically in the service of the board, de facto they have ceased to be so.""  In accordance with the Agbettoh decision, I would order the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the plaintiffs including the trainee plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive salaries to the dates of their respective de facto termination which are 1 January 1984, 6 February 1984 and 15 November 1984 respectively and so (i) in the case of the first batch from 31 October 1982 to 1 January 1984; (ii) in the case of the second batch, from 7 February 1983 to 6 February 1984; and (iii) in the case of the third batch from 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984.  (b) For all the plaintiffs additional twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of de facto termination.  (c) Since I have held that de jure they are still employees having declared their dismissals null and void, they will be entitled to earned leave allowance, bonus, long service awards, including food packages and all the other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman's agreement, all these to be converted if feasible into cash as at the respective dates of their de facto termination.  (d) Their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement.  In calculating entitlement, account should be taken of any period within which an employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by that award.  I am firmly of the view that the L.O.A., in so far as it conflicts with the collective agreement which has support in statute, is null and void. The resultant nullity does not imply or mean that an employee subject to the collective agreement cannot enter into a contract to take a loan from his employers. I do not condemn such a loan as long as its terms are not in conflict with the collective agreement. And in any case if the conflicting terms are expunged, the loan contracted remains in full force and the debtor must repay it.  In this case no counterclaim or set off has been pursued by the defendants, in accordance with Order 19, r. 3 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), nevertheless our duty under article 116 of the Constitution, 1979 as continued in force by the \[p.373\] Proclamation, 1981 and P.N.D.C.L. 42, is to do what is right. Clearly it will not be right to sponsor unjust enrichment. We cannot therefore encourage the plaintiffs to repudiate their obligation to repay the loans within the period they undertook to repay. In the circumstance, we order that the plaintiffs fulfil their obligation repay the loans in accordance with its terms as to the period of payment, if they have not done so already.  I would end as I began by making some final remarks. The Valco management at the meeting of 18 October 1982 told the local union and the Workers Defence Committee representatives in effect that the redundancy situation has arisen because of: ""Government directive to the company to curtail energy to the equivalent of 40 per cent of its present consumption by 1 November 1982."" And in a written submission filed on 30 June 1988, on behalf of Valco, counsel for Valco asserted: ""The operative date of curtailment of energy consumption was fixed by government not Valco."" And yet no evidence was led in the entire proceedings to establish this. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the defendants' pleadings rather showed the true position:  �(9) ... as a result of the severe draught which occurred in the country in 1982 through 1983, the output of power from Akosombo was severely reduced in consequence of which the Volta River Authority in three successive stages reduced the defendants' power supply to a mere trickle.  (10) The said power curtailment compelled the defendants to reduce and eventually shut down its entire production for all practical purposes.""  With regard to the workers defence committee and the local union, their behaviour at the meeting of 18 October 1983 is thus reflected in the record of proceedings:  ""The union/W.D.C. team intimated that it wanted government participation ... and management provided a bus for the union/ WDC team to travel to Accra to consult government.""  I cannot help stating that in my view, the manner in which the parties attempted to introduce a government dimension into this case is deplorable. When persons have obligations by law or are by law given duties and functions to perform, it appears to me to be a dereliction of duty, if they endeavour to involve State organs, or they run to government seeking instructions as to how they are to carry out their statutory duties and functions or the manner in which they are to discharge their legal obligations. Such conduct, in my opinion, smacks of sycophancy and is not conducive to the development of responsible citizenry. I say no more, but it follows from the legal \[p.374\] considerations which I have painstakingly canvassed in this judgment that I would dismiss the appeal of the defendant-company and I would allow the appeal of the plaintiffs to the extent indicated in this judgment.  The plaintiffs' appeal is accordingly allowed with costs.  JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS J.S.C.  I agree.  JUDGEMENT OF OSEI-HWERE J.S.C.  I agree.  JUDGMENT OF OFORI-BOATENG J.A.  I also agree.  JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI J.S.C  In 1982 following severe drought conditions, the water in the Volta lake at Akosombo fell to a very low level. As a result, the Volta River Authority called upon the defendants, the Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. of Tema, to shut down two out of their five potlines as from 1 November 1982. This reduction of power to the defendants' smelter at Tema meant a reduction of production. The defendants therefore decided to reduce their labour force and opened negotiations with the local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union. Certain terms were agreed upon which have become known as the ""leave of absence without pay/recall programme (L.O.A.) under which the plaintiffs, among others, were sent home on the understanding that if power were restored they might be given back their jobs. Certain payments in cash and kind were made to them to enable them eke out a living while they waited to be recalled.  The workers were sent home on various dates. Three are mentioned in the evidence, namely, February and November 1982 and December 1983. The plaintiffs say that they were not recalled and have sued the defendants for a declaration that the termination of their employment was a nullity, recovery of arrears of salary and allowances and damages. The pith of their case was that the agreement under which they were discharged from the service of the defendants was illegal, null and void in that it was not negotiated between the proper parties and was against the collective agreement entered into between the defendants and the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union.  The action was tried before Benin J. in the High Court, Accra. He agreed that the local union was a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union, but said that from the evidence he was satisfied that they had no mandate from the parent union to negotiate on its behalf. He rejected the contrary evidence of Kwasi Danso Acheampong who in October 1982 was the secretary of the interim management committee of the Industrial and Commercial Workers \[p.375\] Union. This gentleman was also the secretary of the local branch of the union and was later to become the national vice chairman. He gave a full account of the discussions which took place between the workers' representatives and the government at which it was explained that a shut down of the potlines could not be avoided. Among the workers' representatives were not only Danso-Acheampong himself, but also Aboagye and Ocloo who were chairmen of the interim management committees of the Trade Union Congress and of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union respectively. The upshot of these discussions was that the local branch of the union and another body, the workers defence committee (W.D.C.), were empowered to negotiate with the defendants to avoid redundancy. The result was the L.O.A.. He testified that the workers were kept fully informed throughout the discussions and negotiations.  On the second issue, Benin J. held that having regard to section 10 (4) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) the parties to the L.O.A. could not lawfully vary the redundancy provisions of the collective agreement. But a look at section 10 (4) of Act 299 shows that the provision was intended to protect workers from exploitation by their employers: so that if the variation of the collective agreement were to give the worker more rights and benefits than he would have had under the collective agreement, it would be the height of irony if such an agreement were to be declared unlawful. In such a case, I believe, practical considerations and commonsense would override the strict interpretation of the law, Afterall, the object of negotiating with the defendants was to obtain for the workers more favourable terms than they would have got by implementing the redundancy provisions of the collective agreement. On the basis of his findings, the learned judge came to the conclusion that the termination of the employment of the plaintiffs was wrongful.  It seems that some of the plaintiffs are not employees of the defendants at all. It was proved that they were persons being trained by the defendants with a view to being given employment in the future. As regards these workers, the trial judge found that they were not members of the union and were specifically excluded from the operation of the collective agreement. He rejected their claim in its entirety. He further found that the L.O.A. was negotiated to cover only those workers who were sent home on 1 November 1982. Those sent home on 7 February 1983 and in December 1983 were not covered by any agreement. But, as he agrees, the situation which led to the negotiation of the L.O.A. in 1982 had arisen again in 1983 because the Volta River Authority had asked the defendants to shut down a third potline with effect from 7 February 1983. Was it reasonable to expect the parties to reconvene to negotiate a fresh agreement, or could they \[p.376\] declare formally that the old shall apply to the second and third batches of employees to be sent home? The defendants chose the latter course. The trial judge held that the termination of employment of the second and third batches of employees was also wrongful.  Having drawn these conclusions from the evidence, the learned judge proceeded to consider the remedies. He decided that those of the plaintiffs who had made out their case were not entitled to be reinstated in their posts, but only to damages for wrongful dismissal. He awarded them (i) salary up to 1 January 1984, i.e. the date by which under the L.O.A. they were to consider themselves as having been declared redundant if they had not been recalled; (ii) twelve months' salary being a reasonable period after 1 January 1984 within which they could seek alternative employment; (iii) two months' salary for being declared redundant without notice; and (iv) leave allowance, bonus, long service award and end of service award as at the date they were sent home. Finally he ordered that they refund the amounts they received as bonus in the implementation of the L.O.A..  Both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed from this judgment to the Court of Appeal: (see Nartey-Tokoli v. Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. \[1987-88\] 2 G.L.R. 532, C.A.). Wuaku J.S.C. allowed the appeal against the second award; Ampiah and Essiem JJ.A. dismissed it, but substituted four months for twelve. Wuaku J.S.C. affirmed the order that the loans granted to the plaintiffs under the L.O.A. be taken into account. Ampiah and Essiem JJ.A. were silent over the subject. Once again, both parties have appealed, and the question is whether the judgment of the High Court, as varied, is sound.  The power of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union (I.C.U.) to negotiate on behalf of employees of the Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd. is derived from section 3 of Act 299 under which a certificate may be issued to a trade union appointing it as the appropriate representative of the workers to conduct collective bargaining with the employers. Section 10 (2) makes a collective agreement legally binding. As to the effect of conflicting agreements, section 10 (4) provides:  ""(4) The rights conferred on an employee by a collective agreement under this Act shall be rights which cannot be waived by the employee and, if there is any conflict between a term of a collective agreement under this Act and the terms of any contract not contained in such a collective agreement, then the collective agreement shall prevail, whether or not the contract was concluded before the collective agreement.""  If, therefore, it is shown that the effect of the L.O.A. was to diminish the rights or entitlement of any worker or class of workers, the terms \[p.377\] of the collective agreement will prevail. There is, however, nothing to stop an employee from taking the benefit of the programme if it is more advantageous to him. With the affairs of the I.C.U. and the Trade Union Congress in the hands of unofficial interim management committees, it is difficult to see who else the defendants could have entered into negotiations with other than the local branch of the union.  The agreement entered into by the defendants with their workers was intended to be for their mutual benefit. The defendants would be spared the permanent loss of skilled labour which might be needed when the potlines were reopened; the workers had the prospect of being re-engaged in employment they were used to. In this context, the trainees were not in a different position, even though they were not strictly-speaking employees. Since they too were required to stand by till 1 January 1984 to see if they would be re-engaged there was no rational basis for holding that they were entitled to nothing. This part of the judgment does not find favour with me, and I would, therefore order that they be paid training allowances and other benefits set out in the Valco management trainees conditions of service (see exhibit 3) up to and including the month ending December 1983.  Article 14 (e) of the collective agreement provides that ""employees to be declared redundant will be given two (2) months' notice or be paid in lieu."" The L.O.A. stated that if a worker was not recalled by 1 January 1984 he was to consider himself as having been declared redundant on 1 November 1982. Thus, instead of giving notice to the worker of a redundancy to take place in the future, he was given notice of a redundancy which was to be deemed as having taken place in the past. Clearly, article 14 (e) was not complied with, and two months' salary will have to be paid to each of the affected workers.  There are other benefits to which all or some of the plaintiffs who were employees may be entitled. These are: (i) accrued leave (article 36 (i); (ii) leave travelling expenses (article 13 and 36); (iii) rent subsidy (article 37); (iv) annual bonus (article 39); (v) end of service benefits (article 40 (d); and (vi) provident fund (article 44 (3) (c). Upon proof in each particular case, these are to be paid.  This leaves the thorny issue of damages. The High Court judge awarded twelve months' salary. The majority of the Court of Appeal reduced this to four. Wuaku J.S.C., on the other hand, was of the view that none was payable. The award as damages of a sum more than the salary that would have been earned if proper notice had been given finds support in Hemans v. Ghana National Trading Corporation \[1978\] G.L.R. 4, C.A. As here, the contract of employment was set out in a collective agreement. This provided that except in those cases where a worker might be dismissed summarily, a written warning should first be issued. Hemans having been dismissed without such \[p.378\] warning the question arose whether he was entitled to more than the one month's salary in lieu of notice provided for under the agreement. On this, the court, per Archer J.A. (as he then was), said at 10:  ""It seems to me that if the compensation for lawful termination is one month's pay after the employee had been fore-warned, then it should appear preposterous to award the same one month's salary where the termination as in this case has been held to be unlawful.""  The court proceeded to award four months' salary. It said that this was a reasonable period in which Hemans might look for a new job.  With respect, it is a contradiction in terms to speak of compensation for lawful termination of employment. If the termination is lawful the worker may be called upon to work during the period of notice. Any payment made to him during the period is not compensation or damages, but wages or salary due to him under the contract of employment. If it were damages he could not be compelled to render any services as a condition for being paid. It is the readiness of the employee to work and the unwillingness of the employer to permit him to do so that makes the termination wrongful and entitles the worker to receive as damages what he would have earned if the contract of service had been observed.  We have been referred to Cox v. Phillips Industries \[1975\] I.C.R. 344 where Lawton J. awarded the plaintiff who had been paid five contract months' salary in lieu of notice as required by his contract of employment �500 damages for emotional upset. In that case it was pleaded that prior to being declared redundant the plaintiff had contrary to the contract been demoted to a position of lesser responsibility and that this had entailed financial loss to him. Such a claim may be maintainable, but the award of damages on the ground that the breach had resulted in depression, anxiety and sickness cannot be supported having regard to the decision of the House of Lords in Addis v. Gramophone Co. Ltd. \[1909\] A.C. 488. See also Bliss v. South East Thames Regional Health Authority \[1987\] I.C.R. 700.  Before I conclude, let me say that Vine v. National Dock Labour Board \[1957\] Ac. 488, H.L. and Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 G.L.R. 122, C.A. which were referred to in the argument can be easily distinguished. The defendants are not a statutory body, and the issue here is not whether the power to bring the contract of service to an end can be delegated. In Bank of Ghana v. Nyarko \[1973\] 2 G.L.R. 265, C.A. Apaloo J.A. (as he then was) warned of the danger of stretching the ratio in the Vine case too far. Agbettoh (supra) also concerned a statutory corporation and was to decide whether the \[p.379\] termination of the contract of service without just cause was a violation of article 138 (b) of the Constitution, 1969 of Ghana.  I have been informed beforehand of the orders which my colleagues have agreed among themselves to make. I need hardly say that I am unable to go along with them in the award of damages or the sustaining of claims for Christmas and Easter gifts under a so-called gentleman�s agreement. I have never known a gentleman�s agreement to be enforced in a court of law. For my part, I would allow the appeal of the trainees against the dismissal of their action, as well as that of the defendants against the award of four months� salary as damages. The matter is remitted to the High Court for the assessment of the entitlement of each plaintiff, due regard being had to his indebtedness to the defendants in respect of the loan facility granted him under the L.O.A.. The amounts found due are to be paid with interest from 1 January 1984.  DECISION  Cross-appeal dismissed.  Appeal allowed in part.  L.K.A.  NARTEY-TOKOLI AND OTHERS v.

HEADNOTES  On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court by a four to one majority decision (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (No 2) \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on 20 December 1988 (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 532, CA) which had allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the decision of the trail judge, Benin J. By the said judgment, the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that in purporting to declare redundancy, the defendants, the employers, had failed to follow the procedural machinery set up under the collective agreement entered into by the parties in breach of section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) and that the plaintiffs, the employees, were entitled to a declaration that the purported termination of their employment was null and void and of no effect and that the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal had erred in holding otherwise. The Supreme Court further held that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive them to the dates of their respective de facto termination, including an additional twelve months' salary (awarded by the trial court) as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of the de facto termination of their employment. It was also held that as the termination of their employment was held to be void, they remained employees de jure and would therefore be entitled to earned leave allowance, bonus, including food packages and all other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman agreement basis - all of which should be converted into cash if feasible as at the respective dates of the plaintiffs' de facto dismissal. It was also held that in calculating their entitlements, accounts should be taken of any period within which any employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by the award. In the instant application by the plaintiffs for a review \[p.514\] of the majority judgment of the Supreme Court, counsel for the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that: (i) having declared their dismissal a nullity, the plaintiffs remained de jure in the employment of the defendants and therefore the Supreme Court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of the judgment as damages for unlawful dismissal and not the mere twelve months' salary granted by the trial court and affirmed by the Supreme Court; (ii) that in any event, the plaintiffs were entitled to nothing less than two years' salary as damages following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA; and (iii) since courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship, ergo an employee whose dismissal had been declared void and of no effect (as in the instant case) could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out.  Held, dismissing the application: (1) the applicants had failed to show the existence of exceptional circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  Per curiam. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit of inappropriate and undeserving cases.  Per Osei-Hwere JSC. The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to mitigation of damages. Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137 cited.  Per Aikins JSC. I have considered ... the argument of counsel for the applicants, and regret that I am not at all convinced to accede to the application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge \[by his decision affirmed by the Supreme Court\] acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unapproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.  (2) Per Francois JSC, Amua-Sekyi JSC and Ofori-Boateng JA. The two-years salary award as damages for unlawful dismissal made in the Agbettoh case, was a reasonable compromise - not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period was certain (as in the instant case, with twelve or fourteen months as the expected period of lay-offs) it was unnecessary to determine the reasonable period. The time stated was itself definitive of reasonableness. Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA explained.  Per Francois JSC. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants because their termination has been declared null and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case...The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.  \[p.515\]  Per Osei-Hwere JSC. In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise, the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendants from dismissing them or specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages.  \[EDITORIAL NOTE: Decision of the Supreme Court in Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (No 2) \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante affirmed.\]  CASES REFERRED TO  (1) Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC.

The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Osei-Hwere JSC.  \[p.516\]  COUNSEL  Jones-Mensah for the applicants.  Thompson for the respondents (holding brief for George Bannerman).  JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS JSC.  On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court delivered its decision in the above appeal: (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC). Before 26 November 1987 that decision would have conclusively ended this protracted matter. The significance of 26 November 1987 is that it marked the advent of an epoch-making decision: the ruling in Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC which held that this Court had power to review its own judgments and consequently formulated tests for the institution of the review jurisdiction. Since then, a number of applications for review have been determined by this court. The synthesised ratio for success is the existence of exceptional circumstances negating the soundness of a decision and compelling its vacation to obviate a miscarriage of justice.  The review jurisdiction, it has been emphasised ad nauseam, is not another avenue for appeal or a forum for canvassing lost causes. Unfortunately, if the statistics are any guide, this appears to be the erroneous perception of a number of litigants. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit inappropriate and undeserving cases. The absence of a rigid definition notwithstanding, what is exceptional can hardly escape notice. A few examples have been given in previous rulings of this court and need no reiteration.  This court normally would resist the temptation of being drawn into expatiating on its judgment with explanations or justifications. This inhibition cannot, however, extend over mischievous or wilful misreading of all important precedent upon which a decision rests.  In Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA, the court made pronouncements which ensured that statutorily protected contracts would retain their protection under the aegis of the court's jurisdiction. This decision in certain areas, deviated from the beaten track of master and servant contractual relationships well-known in Anglo-American jurisprudence. The applicants herein aridly dismiss the Agbettoh decision as affording no legal solace. That decision is repudiated as: ""not founded on any principle known to the law"", and occasioning ""a fundamental error.""  If that were the case, one wonders why an exercise for a review has been embarked upon at all. For it was upon the superstructure of Agbettoh that the applicants' victory was founded. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants, Valco, because their termination has been declared null \[p.517\] and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case. The intervention of the court upon the applicants' institution of a claim in legal proceedings, brought an end to the status held by the parties prior to the suit. The court merely moved on to make just awards from a de facto situation.  The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case, also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.  A two-year award was a reasonable compromise, not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period is certain, as in the instant case, with twelve months or fourteen months as the expected period of lay offs, no arithmetic is required to determine a reasonable period. The time stated is itself definitive of reasonableness. In the calculation of the three batches of employees laid off at various dates, it is agreed that a mathematical error occurred in computing the third batch as deserving a twelve-month award instead of fourteen. This error could have been corrected under the slip rule for which provision has been made under article 116 (4) of the Constitution, 1979. There was no need for a full blown review.  I set out accordingly, what I consider a relevant extract in the Agbettoh case (supra) at 131-132:  ""It follows that in so far as the plaintiffs sought to have it declared that their purported retirements were a nullity inasmuch as they violated a constitutional injunction, they were entitled to that declaration. The plaintiffs did not themselves seek the declarations in those terms and beyond stating that the respondents were \`entitled to all the reliefs indorsed on their writ', the judge below did not direct his mind to the declarations sought. But inasmuch as what we have held can be said to be the substance of the declaratory reliefs granted to the plaintiffs, we affirm them.  With regard to the claim in the nature of perpetual injunction to restrain the board from ejecting them from their bungalows and the payment of salaries, we see some practical difficulties. It would be unreal to assume that the status quo in 1979 still exists five years afterwards in 1984. Clearly, the plaintiffs have not \[p.518\] worked for the board all these years. They themselves were under an obligation to minimise their losses by seeking and obtaining alternative jobs. For all we know, they may well have found themselves other jobs and have been comfortably settled. To affirm today an order which secures them bungalows which they only had when they were in the actual service of the board or to order that salaries be paid to them for those years when they did not work for the board, albeit through no fault of their own, would be to set our face against realities. The reality of the situation is that although de jure they are still technically in the service of the board, de facto they have ceased to be so since November 1979.  In all the circumstances, we think we should mark our disapproval of their unconstitutional retirement by ordering that the appellant board pay each as compensation, two years' salary from November 1979. They should also, of course, receive their other entitlements under their contracts of service or under the board's scheme. In so far as the judge's orders properly construed, enjoin the board to keep them as it were perpetually in their residential accommodation and to pay them salaries and other benefits as if they were in actual rather than constructive service of the board, those orders ought not to be allowed to stand. We disaffirm and set them aside.""  It is a basic requirement for all courts which practice equity, to deny unjust enrichment to all suitors. No court should allow unmerited largesse to the detriment of an innocent party. It was upon this well-known notion of fairness that this court declared that those plaintiffs who had secured employment before the dates stated in their respective ""Leave of absence without pay/recall"" (LOA) programmes-which had been negotiated between the defendants and the local union of the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of the Trades Union Congress of Ghana (ICU) had run out, would have such earnings taken into account in the final calculation of their just deserts. Indeed it is trite law that the applicants herein had a duty to mitigate their losses. It would therefore have been illogical and a legal breach if such earnings were not subject to deductions.  Finally, this court ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for their entitlements to be calculated. It is patent that all entitlements are open for consideration at that forum, even the indices of money depreciation. Save for the correction affecting the fourteen months' entitlement of the third batch of employees who were laid off, I think this application is without merit and must be dismissed.  \[p.519\]  JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI JSC.  I agree.  JUDGMENT OF OFORI-BOATENG JA.  I also agree.  JUDGMENT OF OSEI-HWERE JSC.  The applicants' motion prays for a review of the judgment of this court delivered on 8 March 1990: see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante. The judgment varied, to the advantage of the applicants, the decision of the Court of Appeal. It particularly decreed, contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal and of the trial court, that the termination of the appointments of all the plaintiff-applicants including an unspecified number who were trainees, was null and void. The two courts below had dismissed the action as against the trainees and had held that the dismissal of the successful plaintiffs was only wrongful and not void. The Court of Appeal had, by obvious inadvertence, seemingly confined its pecuniary awards on to those of the first batch of dismissed employees so entitled to the said awards but the judgment of this court had corrected the error and extended the awards to all the employees of the second and third batches as well.  The period during which the employees were forced to stay at home in terms of the LOA programme presented no difficulty. All the three graduated courts were in common agreement that the successful plaintiffs were to be paid their salaries and other entitlements for that period. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeal allowed an additional two months' salary in lieu of notice. This court rejected the two months' salary. The trial judge additionally allowed, by way of damages, twelve months' salary. The Court of Appeal whittled it down to four months' salary. The decision of this court, however, restored the twelve months awarded by the court of first instance. On top of these awards it revived and allowed the claim of the plaintiffs based on the so-called ""gentleman's agreement"" such as the food packages, which the two courts below had rejected. Like the Court of Appeal, this court also allowed the plaintiffs their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement.  One would have thought that, having retrieved large chunks of their benefits thrown away, the plaintiffs would have found final contentment. But not so the implacable plaintiffs. They hunger for more benefits and to be satisfied they call for a review of those parts of the judgment of this court which dissatisfy them. They have set these down as follows:  ""(a) The order that the plaintiffs' salaries, benefits and entitlements be paid effective from the respective dates of the Plaintiff's de facto terminations, ie 31 October 1982, 6 February 1984, and 15 November 1984.  \[p.520\]  (b) The order awarding the plaintiffs only twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal from the effective dates of their \`wrongful dismissal.'  (c) The order tending to restrict \`all other benefits' to those said to be enjoyed under a so-called gentleman's agreement (which might rashly be interpreted by the defendants to exclude the bi-annual supply of cloths, VIP entitlement, proven hospitalisation, proven children's educational and also medical expenses, etc.)  (d) The order for payment of their other entitlements under article 40.  (e) The order that the third batch of the plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983-15 November 1984.  (f) The order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards.""  The thrust of the argument of counsel for the applicants in support was that since this court decreed the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs to be null and void the effect was that even as at the date of the said decision they remained still in the employment of the defendants. Consequently this court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of judgment by way of damages and not the mere salary for twelve months as ordered. In the case of the first batch of dismissed employees, for instance, they would have scored a period of 34 months from the date of the so-called de facto termination of their appointments to the date of judgment for the purpose of calculating their salaries and entitlements.  It was contended that, at worst, the employees should have been entitled to nothing less than two years' salary (and entitlements) following the decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA-recognised by this court as the king-bolt directing its award of damages to the plaintiffs.  Granted the self-conviction of the applicants in the justice of their motion for review, it is quite obvious that it (the motion) was motivated by their lustful flirtation with the collective agreement contained in exhibit F. The said exhibit F which took effect from I September 1986 replaced exhibit A and provided for more enhanced conditions of service. It stands to reason that the applicants could only benefit under the enhanced exhibit F if this court could be persuaded to stretch the period for the calculation of damages over and above the effective date of exhibit F. The defendant-respondents oppose the motion on the ground that the judgment touching those matters \[p.521\] complained of do not contain any fundamental and basic error giving rise to a gross miscarriage of justice. On the contrary, they made bold to say that if there should be any review at all it should, for instance, be for the purpose of correcting the error of making an award based on the gentleman's agreement which, according to the defendants, was clearly not justiciable and had no foundation in contract.  Some recent decisions of this court have exposed the paradigm for invoking its review jurisdiction. And here I refer particularly to decisions like Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC and Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC. The central theme of these decisions is that the applicant must be able to point at some exceptional circumstances giving rise to a miscarriage of justice before the Supreme Court will be inclined to review its own decision. Although the Supreme Court may not use its review jurisdiction to embark on an apologia, yet I cannot wholly resist the temptation to consider the instant application, if only to chase away some of the lingering cobwebs floating in the minds of the disputants.  In this regard it will be useful to appreciate the status of the plaintiffs. At common law there is no requirement that an employer should proceed in a particular manner before he dismisses an employee. There is no obligation to comply with the rules of natural justice: see Ridge v Baldwin \[1964\] AC 40, HL; and the failure to warn, consult or allow an employee to state his case prior to dismissal cannot affect the validity of his dismissal: see Pepper v Webb \[1969\], 2 All ER 216, CA and Wilson v Racher \[1974\] ICR 428. The only situation in which the common law guarantees procedural rights to working people is where it can be established that there is an element of public employment or service, or some degree of statutory regulation, or that the employment is something in the character of an office: see Mallock v Aberdeen Corporation \[1971\] 2 All ER 1278, HL. The plaintiffs held no public offices which gave them basic rights to the security of their jobs. The collective agreement which permitted the employer's right to terminate an employee's appointment with notice did not assure the plaintiffs their basic rights to the security of their jobs. Rather, by confirming a collective agreement, the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) accords all workmen that come within the ambit of the legislation, procedural rights or safeguards which are, without doubt, a considerable advance towards building for employees a more secure form of job rights.  The dispute that resulted in the final judgment for which a review is now being sought was, to me, unfortunate to the extreme. It focused on how in the complex field of employment protection a procedural \[p.522\] arm of industrial relations law could strike with a resounding slap at even the most conscientious and fair-minded employer who in handling redundancy dismissals, was concerned in formulating a ""survival plan"" with the local representatives of the workers themselves. Be that as it may, our decision that the breach of the statutory procedure rendered the dismissals of the plaintiffs a nullity was no ground to disturb the quantum of the damages awarded (except to correct an arithmetical error) and expand it up to the date of judgment.  In the statements filed on behalf of the plaintiffs before the appeal came to be heard their counsel spared no pains in fully arguing the case for the payment of salaries up to the date of judgment. The review application sought to reargue the same case. It had been contended, by relying on a number of foreign authorities, that the courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship. Ergo an employee whose dismissal was void could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out. My reading of the cases cited in support clearly demonstrate that there were special circumstances which invited the courts to make any such orders.  In Hill v C A Parsons & Co Ltd \[1972\] I Ch 305, CA for instance, the plaintiff was due to retire in two years time and was likely to benefit from Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 which was about to take effect when his appointment was terminated by one month's notice instead of six months'. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from implementing the notice on the grounds that in the exceptional circumstances of the relationship between the parties and the plaintiff's likely protection by the coming into operation of Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 before a fresh notice could take effect, his contract of employment was still subsisting and damages not being at all adequate remedy, he was entitled to the interim injunction. Again in Jones v Lee (1911) 106 LT 123 it was held on appeal that the plaintiff had a right to be heard and represented before any decision relating to his dismissal was taken by the defendants who had acted wrongly in purporting to dismiss him and that interlocutory injunction should be granted. Each case, ultimately, must be decided on its own merit.  In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendant from dismissing them or for specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages. Although the courts strive to arrive at what is fair and just in their awards of damages for wrongful or illegal termination of employment such \[p.523\] awards are bound to be irrational as they proceed from the discretion of individual judges and the circumstances for the awards may hardly remain the same. It is only natural that this irrationality is also bound to breed disquiet in industrial relations.  Whatever be the progressive trend by the courts elsewhere towards shielding employees from undue hardship resulting from illegal dismissals which counsel for the plaintiffs has commended for our espousal, that trend has today been halted in England by legislation to inject some sanity, at least, in the award of damages for wrongful or illegal redundancy dismissal. The relevant legislation is the Employment Protection Act, 1975. Under the said Act, an employer proposing to dismiss as redundant an employee of a description in respect of which an independent trade union is recognised by him, is obliged to consult representatives of that trade union about the dismissal at the earliest opportunity, but in any event where he proposes to dismiss ten or more employees at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, at least 60 days before the first of those dismissals takes effect-section 99. Under section 101, an appropriate trade union may present a complaint to an industrial tribunal on the ground that an employer has dismissed or proposes to dismiss as redundant one or more employees and has not complied with any of the requirements of section 99. Where the tribunal finds the complaint well-founded it shall make a declaration to that effect and it may also make a protective award which will oblige the employer to pay remuneration for a protected period.  The protected period, under the same section 101 (5) is:  "". . . a period beginning with the date on which the first of the dismissals to which the complaint relates takes effect, or the date of the award, whichever is earlier, of such length as the tribunal shall determine to be just and equitable in all the circumstances having regard to the seriousness of the employer's default in complying with any requirement of section 99 (of the Act) ...  in the case of a proposal to dismiss 100 or more employees within a period of 90 days. In a case where more than ten employees are to be dismissed at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, the period is 60 days, and in any other case it is 28 days. By section 102 of the Act, any payment under a protective award in respect of any period shall go towards discharging any liability of the employer under, or in respect of breach of the contract of employment in respect of that period.  In Talke Fashions Ltd v Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades \[1978\] 2 All ER 649, EAT it was held that the intention of the legislation in dealing with industrial relations was to \[p.524\] compensate an employee for the loss he had suffered by reason of unfair treatment by his employer and not to impose penalties on the employer for his default. It was held further (as stated in the headnote at 650) that:  ""The making of a protective award under s 101 (3) was discretionary, but if an award was to be made its period was at large up to a fixed maximum. The primary consideration in determining the period of the award was the effect on the employee of the employer's failure to consult his union, bearing in mind that, by s 101 (5), the period of the award was to be linked to the period of notice required by s 99 to be given to the union for consultation. Although the seriousness of the employer's default was by s 101 (5), a factor to be taken into consideration and might increase the period of the award, it was to be considered not in isolation but in relation to the consequences to the employee of the failure to consult, and the fact that there had been serious default on the part of the employer did not mean that the maximum protective award was to be made unless the employer showed mitigating circumstances . . .""  Again in Spillers-French (Holdings) Ltd v Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers \[1980\] 1 All ER 231 it was held that:  ""(i) The purpose of a protective award was to compensate for an employer's failure to consult the appropriate union within the required time in respect of proposed dismissals for redundancy, and not merely to compensate for loss or potential loss of the employees' remuneration. The relevant factors, therefore, in deciding whether to make a protective award were the number of days of consultation lost by the employer's breach of s 99 of the 1975 Act and the seriousness of the breach.""  In my opinion there is an urgent call for reform of the law on the lines of the Employment Protection Act, 1975 which will permit the court to make protective awards within a protected period. It is enough to say that as compared to what their counterparts would have received under a protective award the plaintiffs have exceedingly enjoyed the largesse of the court for which they should remain grateful.  Apart from holding that de jure the plaintiffs were all still employees and for that reason they were entitled to the food packages and all the other benefits enjoyed on the basis of a so-called gentleman's agreement, the majority judgment of this court did not advance any other reasons for so holding. It is clear that the specific awards made under head (c) of the majority decisions fall under the \[p.525\] rubric of ""benefits."" The food packages were clearly an incentive or productive bonus worked into the wages structure. This is confirmed by exhibit J. For the avoidance of doubt I feel that it will be necessary to define benefits since the awards under head (c) include ""all the other benefits.""  The term ""benefits"" as employed in an ""agreement"" between an employer and his employee is in my view synonymous with ""remuneration."" In S & U Stores Ltd v Lee \[1969\] 2 All ER 417, the court (Lord Parker CJ, Melford Stevenson and Blain JJ) had to define ""remuneration."" It was held that ""remuneration"" was not mere payment for work done but was what the doer expected to get as the result of the work he did in so far as what he expected to get was quantified in terms of money. The above definition was, however, not followed in S & U Stores Ltd v Wilkes \[1974\] 3 All ER 401, NIRC. Here the court laid down the test for determining ""remuneration"" as (1) any sum paid as a wage or salary without qualification is part of the employee's remuneration; (2) the value of any benefit in kind (eg free accommodation) or paid in cash by someone other than the employer is to be disregarded as not forming part of the remuneration; (3) any sum which is agreed to be paid by way of reimbursement or on account of expenditure incurred by the employee to the extent that that sum represented a profit or surplus in his hands rather than a genuine reimbursement of expenditure. See also section 35 (2) of the Labour Regulations, 1969 (LI 632) where the expression ""full pay"" is defined as ""the worker's normal remuneration (without overtime payment) including the cash equivalent of any remuneration in kind.""  I would opt for the definition in Wilkes' case. It follows from the above definition that the value of any benefit in kind paid or supplied by the employer, such as the food package, will form part of the ""remuneration"" or ""benefits."" With this test it should not be difficult to ascertain the ""other benefits"" enjoyed by the plaintiffs.  The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to the mitigation of damages: see Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137, EAT. Except as to the minor correction which is to be made in calculating the awards in respect of the third batch, I would also dismiss the motion.  JUDGMENT OF AIKINS JSC.  The defendants in this case, the Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (popularly referred to as Valco), are a limited liability company operating in Tema, and the plaintiffs were employees of the defendants. Their conditions of employment are spelt out in a \[p.526\] collective agreement which their union, the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) entered into on their behalf with Valco, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299).  The trial judge, Benin J, after hearing evidence from the plaintiffs and the defendants, delivered judgment in which he held, after a thorough consideration and careful evaluation of the evidence, that ""most of the plaintiffs were wrongfully dismissed by the defendant - company"", and that some of the plaintiffs who were said to be persons trained by the defendants with a view to being employed at a later date, were not members of the union and were specifically excluded from the operation of the collective agreement. He therefore rejected their claim in its entirety. He further found that the LOA programme was negotiated to cover only those workers who were sent home on I November 1982. The learned trial judge further held that the plaintiffs who had made out their case were not entitled to be reinstated in their posts, and awarded them damages for wrongful dismissal made up of the following:  ""(1) salary up to 1 January 1984, the date by which they were to consider themselves as having been declared redundant under the LOA programme if they had not been recalled;  (2) twelve months' salary being a reasonable period after 1 January 1984 within which they could seek alternative employment;  (3) two months' salary for being declared redundant without notice; and  (4) leave allowance, bonus, long service awards as at the date they were sent home, provided these were earned, but had not been already paid to them.""  He excluded claims for food packages and other claims founded on what the plaintiffs referred to as a gentleman's agreement and which they contended they would have been entitled to if they had not been dismissed. He ordered that they should refund the amounts they received as loans in the implementation of the LOA programme.  From this judgment both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs' complaint covered the following matters:  (1) The decision that trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.  (2) The decision that the termination of the respective appointments of the plaintiffs were only wrongful and not void.  (3) The decision that the food packages did not form part of the plaintiffs' enforceable conditions of service.  \[p.527\]  (4) The restriction of the compensation to twelve months.  (5) Inadequate and unreasonable awards.  The defendants' appeal covered the whole of the decision save the following:  (1) The judge's decision in regard to the trainees.  (2) His decision rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void.  (3) His holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to food packages and other benefits said to be due to them on a gentleman's agreement basis.  By a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court holding:  (a) that the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs for wrongful termination of their employment;  (b) rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void; and  (c) that the trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.  With respect to damages the Court of Appeal by a majority of two to one held that the plaintiffs were entitled to four months' salary as at 31 December 1983 in addition to the two months, salary in lieu of notice, and ordered as follows:  ""The parties are hereby ordered to appear before the court below to calculate how much is due to each of the successful plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from the date of termination to 31 December 1983 and all other entitlements such as earned leave allowance, bonus, long service award, and end of service benefits as at the date each of them was laid off as provided for under the collective agreement ... These to be determined as at 31 December 1983.  (b) Four months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (c) Two months' salary as at 31 December 1983.  (d) Their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement.""  From this judgment the plaintiffs and the defendants each appealed to the Supreme Court.  On 8 March 1990 this court (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) by a majority of four to one, after an exhaustive consideration of the evidence and reasoning, held that the purported termination of the plaintiffs' employment was null and void and of no effect, and should be accordingly vacated. The court also held that the trainees were employees who were subject to the provisions of the collective \[p.528\] agreement, the moment they joined Valco, and they were wrongfully dismissed, their dismissal being null and void and of no effect.  This court therefore ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the plaintiffs including the trainee plaintiffs as follows:  (a) Their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive salaries to the dates of their respective de facto termination which are I April 1984, 6 February 1984 and 15 November 1984 respectively and so in the case of the first batch:  (i) from 31 October 1982 to 1 January 1984; and. in the case of the second batch:  (ii) from 7 February 1983 to 6 February 1984; and in the case of the third batch:  (iii) from 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984.  (b) For all the plaintiffs additional twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of their de facto termination,  (c) Since it has been held that de jure they are still employees having declared their dismissals null and void they will be entitled to leave allowance, bonus, long service awards, including food packages and all the other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman's agreement, all these to be converted if feasible to cash as at the respective dates of their de facto termination.  (d) Their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement.  Finally this court ordered that the plaintiffs fulfil their obligation to repay the loans granted to them under the LOA agreement in accordance with its terms as to period of payment, if they have not already done so. The court further ordered that in calculating the entitlements, account should be taken of any period within which an employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by that award.  It is from this judgment that the plaintiffs have applied to this court again for a review of the judgment. Mr Jones-Mensah, counsel for the plaintiffs, urged before us that to compensate rights and entitlements declared de jure with only twelve months' damages, can only mean that there is no jurisprudential difference between the verdict of wrongful dismissal and that of a declaration of nullity in terms of relief, and cited the case of Sowah v Bank for Housing and Construction \[1982-83\] GLR 1324, SC, emphasising the rate of inflation in the economy and the decline in the purchasing power of the cedi.  \[p.529\]  In reply counsel for the defendants, Mr Thompson who held brief for Mr Bannerman, persuaded us in very strong terms that a party invoking the review jurisdiction of the court must show that there are exceptional circumstances which call for a review, ie (i) a fundamental and basic error may have inadvertently been committed by the court; and (ii) the error must have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice and he quoted in support of his contention a passage from the case of Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC.  He further submitted that such an application for review should not be used for an interpretation of the court's decision or directions from the court or for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. He urged that the principle on which the de facto termination date was fixed for each batch was taken from the Court of Appeal decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984- 86\] 1 GLR 122 CA, the relevant part of which was quoted at 372 ante of the majority judgment in this case . The question, he argued, was considered by the court and the applicants have not shown that there is a fundamental and basic error which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice to them.  The views of this court on the issue were succinctly stated in the majority judgment delivered on 8 March 1990 where Taylor JSC after referring to the cases of Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra); Hemans v Ghana National Trading Corporation \[1978\] GLR 4 and the view of Dorman CJ in Harlley v Harman (1840) 3 ER 617, said at 371 ante:  ""It follows from those authorities that I accept and adopt the reasoning of Apaloo CJ in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra) and I agree with the views of Archer JA (as he then was) in the Hemans case (supra). In the instant case, the trial High Court judge gave adequate reasons in the exercise of his discretion in awarding twelve months' salary as the measure of damages for each plaintiff. In the Agbettoh case (supra) two years' salary was awarded. I think the well-known practice in the conduct of appeals is that where a judge has used his discretion in arriving at a decision, then unless it can be demonstrated that he ignored the law or took into consideration facts that he ought to have excluded or omitted material facts which should have been considered, his conclusion should not be interfered with. Applying this principle, I am unable to appreciate the reasons why the twelve months' period chosen by Benin J in the exercise of his discretion was set aside and I would therefore restore it.""  \[p.530\]  I have considered very carefully the arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs, and regret that I am not at all convinced that I should accede to his application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.  As recent as 1962 when this court was dealing with appeals from the exercise of the court's discretion in the case of Crentsil v Crentsil \[1962\] 2 GLR 171 at 175, SC it emphasised that:  ""...it is a rule of law deep rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of court's discretion save in exceptional circumstances.""  For example, this court would not interfere with the exercise of its discretion on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials, or gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters. In this application no significant exceptional circumstances of proven weight have been urged on this court by counsel for the applicants to warrant interference with exercise of the trial judge's discretion. The application for review on this ground is therefore rejected.  The next ground argued before us by counsel for the applicants is in respect of the order of the court that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards. Counsel urged that since this is a case of invalidated termination, ie one of nullity and not one of wrongful dismissal, it makes no difference in law whether an employee got other employment or not, and is entitled to the full benefit.  Counsel for the defendant thinks that this ground is baseless. He argues that as the LOA exercise has been held not to be one of redundancy and therefore to be null and void, and as the plaintiffs have been held to have been wrongfully dismissed, the benefits they would be entitled to under article 40 of the collective agreement would be those accruing on termination on their employment. It is my view that counsel for the plaintiffs has failed to convince this court of his legitimate claims, and this ground of his application is equally rejected.  \[p.531\]  The next and perhaps the most important ground of substance argued before us by counsel for the plaintiffs is in respect of the order of this court that the third batch of plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983 and 15 November 1984. Counsel submitted that there appears to be a small mistake in the dates, and invited the court to take note of the fact that the nullified LOA programme was effected on the third batch from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985 and not 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984, ie a period of fourteen months. Counsel for the defendants concedes this arithmetical error in the dates and sees no objection to the correct dates being substituted.  It is unfortunate that the correct dates the third batch were laid off should inadvertently elude the, observation of both counsel and this court. There is no doubt that the error is fundamental and basic, and has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The application of counsel for the plaintiffs on this ground for a review succeeds and I order the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the third batch of the plaintiffs as follows:  ""Their salaries from the date they ceased to receive salaries to the date of their de facto termination which is from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985, ie a period of fourteen months.""  Save as ordered above in favour of the third batch of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs' application for review fails to satisfy the test laid down by this court and is dismissed.

"The applicants, children of the testator and executors under his will, on the ground that the three respondents, the customary successor and members of their late father's family, had prevented them from administering the estate, brought an action against them before the High Court, Accra for an order, (I) that the first and second respondents should hand over the keys of their father to them to enable them take inventory; (2) that the second respondent should hand over cattle in his possession to the applicants for distribution; and (3) restraining the respondents from interfering with the administration of the property. The respondents con�tended, inter alia, in their defence that the properties were family properties and therefore the testator could not validly dispose of them in a will. On 12 December 1991, upon the applicants' motion the court directed the first and second res�pondents to hand over the keys to the applicants to enable them take the invent�ory and for the third respondent to hand over the cattle in his possession to the applicants. However, following an application for review of those orders by the respondents, the court on 23 June 1992 directed that the registrar of the court should take the inventory of all the properties and file a report. On 9 December 1992 the court made an order directing the respondents not to intermeddle with the properties listed in the report filed by the registrar. Subsequently, the applicants, on the grounds that (i) when the first applicant went to pack some things in their father's house the respondents had forcibly removed him and then locked the door; and (ii) the second respondent .had put up structures in the house which he was using as a school and that those acts were in breach of the orders of the court, brought a motion for an order of attachment against the respondents. In their opposition to the application the respondents contended, inter alia, that (a) since he court had subsequently appointed the registrar to take inventory and submit a report, the order directing that the applicants should take the inventory had ceased to exist; and therefore they had not intermeddled with \[pg 510\] the property; (b) one ER who had locked the door hfld since died and no one else should be held liable for the act; and (c) the second respondent had put up the structures in the lifetime and with the permission of the testator. They therefore denied that they had flouted the orders of the court.  Held, dismissing the application: (I) since the court on 23 June 1992 reviewed its earlier order of 12 December 1991 directing the applicants to take the inventory, and enjoined the registrar of the court to take the invent�ory, the order of 23 June 1992 constituted a variation of the orders made on 12 December 1991. In the result, the earlier order ceased to have effect. Accordingly, the respondents could not be said to have committed a breach of that non-existent order.  (2) The order of 9 December 1992 directing the respondents not to intermeddle with the properties of the testator, including the house and the cattle, was clear and unambiguous. However, contempt of court was an offence of criminal character and therefore there should be cogent evidence, without any room for doubts incriminating the respondents. Since or. the evidence, it was the late ER who had caused the room to be locked up and there was no evidence that any of the respondents took part in that all, it could not be said that the applicants had proved beyond reasonable doubt, that the respondents had committed that act. Furthermore, since the structures were on the land before the orders were made, it could not be said that there had been subsequent acts of intermeddling in respect of the structures. Accordingly, the respondents were not guilty of contempt.  APPLICATION by the plaintiff-applicants, children and executors of the testator, for an order attaching ~he respondents, the custom(1:j' successor and two members of the testator's family, for contempt for intermeddling with the properties of the testator in breach of the orders of the court. The facts are sufficiently stated in the ruling of the court.  Kojo Anan for the plaintiff-appllicaants.  Brookman-Amissah for the defendant-respondents.  Akoto-Bamfo J . .In this application the plaintiff-applicants (here�inafter referred to as the applicants) pray for an order attaching the bodies of the defendant-respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) for disobeying various orders made by the court since December 1991.  It is, in my view, necessary to give a resume of the events lead�ing to the present application. On 19 September 1991 the applicants took out a writ of summons claiming for: (1) an order that the first \[pg 511\] and second respondents hand over keys belonging to their deceased father to them for inventory to be taken; (2) an order that the third respondent hand over cattle in his possession to the applicants for distribution; and (3) an order restraining the respondents from interfering with the administration of the estate.  The gist of the case for the applicants as per their statement of claim is that their late father, Kweku Ghansah, died testate; his child�ren, the applicants, were appointed executors. The defendants styling themselves as customary successors had, however, prevented them from administering the estate. In their defence, as per their statement of defence, the respondents contended that the will was not valid and furthermore, that since the properties listed in the inventory were  . family properties, the late Kweku Ghansah could not validly dispose of them in a will.  On 12 December 1991, upon the applicants' motion, the court made an order directing that the first and second respondents should hand over the keys to the applicants for them to take inventory and for th~ third respondent to hand over the cattle in his possession. Upon a subsequent application for review by the respondents, the court on 23 June 1992 made an order directing the registrar of the court to go with the parties to take inventory of all the properties and to file a report. The registrar complied with the orders and sub�sequently filed a report. The court thereafter on 9 December 1992 ordered the respondents not to intermeddle with the properties listed in the report submitted by the registrar on 23 June 1992.  Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that various orders made by the court since December 1991, after the grant of probate to them, had been disobeyed by the respondents whose main conten�tion was that wills were alien to their family. According to him, the respondents had committed various acts of disobedience in that in 1993 when the first applicant entered the room of the testator to pack some things, he was forcibly removed by the respondents and the door locked. He submitted that the fact that Esi Rigya who styled herself as customary successor had commenced proceedings at the High Court, Cape Coast did not entitle the respondents to flout the orders made by the court. Additionally, he urged that the second respondent had erected structures in the yard of the testator and was using same as a school without payment of rents to the admi�nistrators. \[pg 512\]  In opposing the application, learned counsel for the respondents contended that the application was brought in bad faith. According to him, after the order of 12 December 1991 which directed that the keys be handed over to the applicants for inventory to be taken, an application for review was considered by the court and that the court on 23 June 1992 reviewed the earlier order made. The -registrar was appointed to take inventory and to submit a report. He, therefore, submitted that the order of 12 December 1991 ceased to operate. He argued that since the only subsisting order was the order of 9 December 1992, and no acts constituting intermeddling had since been committed by the respondents, the application was misconceived. According to him, it was Esi Rigya who had the applicants removed, and with her death, no other person ought to be held liable. With regard to the school, he submitted that the testator, while alive, allowed the second respondent to put up the structure and to run the 'school and he cannot therefore be said to have flouted orders subsequently made.  An injunction is an authoritative form of order made by the court expressly enjoining a party either to do a particular act or to refrain from doing a particular act. The general rule is that it is the duty of those so enjoined strictly to observe the terms of the injunction. The court will punish a person for contempt upon adequate proof that the terms of the injunction are clear and unambiguous; that the respondents had had proper notice of such terms; and that the terms have been broken by the respondents. There is also a requirement of proof that the person had the requisite intent for the breach, and finally, the person responsible for (he breach has to be established. It is necessary therefore to establish clearly the orders made by the court the breach of which is the subject of the applicants' complaint.  It is not controverted that on 11 December 1991 the court made an order directing the first and second respondents to hand over the keys to the applicants in order to take inventory, and for the third respondent to hand over the cattle in his possession for distribution. It is also not in dispute that subsequently the respondents filed an application for a review of the orders of the 11 December 1991. Even though learned counsel for the applicants contended that the orders were not reviewed but that further orders were made, it is clear from the evidence on the record that the court on 23 June 1992 considered the application for review and made an order appointing the registrar \[pg 513\] to take inventory and to submit a report. If by the earlier order the applicants were to take inventory and the latter order enjoined the registrar to take such inventory; it is my considered view that the order of 23 June 1992 constituted a variation of the orders made on 11 December 1991. It is of significance that the registrar did take inventory of the properties in the house as well as the cattle. Since the order of 23 June 1992 did vary the order of 11 December 1991, the latter ceased to have any effect. The respondents cannot therefore be said to have committed a breach of a non-existent order. There is ample evidence before me that after the submission of the report, the court made an order on 9 December 1992 directing the respondents not to intermeddle with the properties listed in the report. This order is the only one to be considered by the court in determining whether there has been a breach. The order is clear and unambiguous that the respondents were not to intermeddle with the properties listed in the report. Among the properties listed were the house of the testator and his personal belongings. Para (2) of the report headed ""Properties"" had family house No F6 listed. The cattle was also included.  Have the terms of the order been broken by the respondents? It is the case for the applicants that the first applicant entered the room of the testator and packed certain things but the respondents forcibly removed him and locked the door and that the second respondent had built structures in the yard of the house of the testator and was using same as a school without paying rents to the administrators. In answer, the respondents contended that it was Esi Rigya who was the culprit and that the second respondent"" built the structures in the lifetime of the testator and with Esi Rigya dead, the acts complained of having occurred since eleven months before the filing of the application, they could not be held responsible for her actions.  Contempt of court being an offence of a criminal character, it must be satisfactorily proved. There must therefore be cogent evidence incriminating the respondent. There must not be any room for doubts. The averments of the respondents that it was Esi Rigya who caused the room to be locked is not denied. It is indeed not clear from the averments of the applicants which of the three respondents did lock the door; the third respondent, for instance, was said to be in charge of the cattle. Was he in the house at the relevant time? Did he take part in the acts complained of? These are questions which cannot be answered on the evidence before me. It is possible \[pg 514\] that he was present and took part; it is also possible that all the three took part; and it is also possible that only one of them committed the act. Since the standard of proof is high it cannot be said that the applicants have proved beyond reasonable doubt that the respondents committed the act.  Furthermore, the registrar was emphatic in her report that she saw the structures complained of when she visited the premises and at a time the order had not been made. The assertion of the second respondent that he had the consent and authority of the testator in his lifetime to put up the structures is not controverted. If the structures were standing before the orders were made, it is my view that it cannot be said that there had been subsequent acts of intermeddling in respect of the structures.  I am unable to find on the evidence before me that the respond�ents are guilty of contempt. The application is accordingly dismissed ..  Application dismissed.

"JUDGMENT  i. Introduction:  \[1\] By a writ of summons sealed at the registry of this Court on July 13, 2016 the Plaintiff claims against the Defendants:  i. A declaration that 1st Defendant was in the ordinary course of his employment with 2nd Defendant when he stabbed Plaintiff causing the injuries she sustained.  ii. A declaration that 2nd Defendant is vicariously liable for the conduct of 1st Defendant when he stabbed Plaintiff resulting in the injuries she sustained.  ii. A declaration that the act of 1st Defendant stabbing Plaintiff resulting in the injuries she sustained is trespass to her person by assault and battery.  iv. General damages  v. Costs  vi. Any other relief(s) this Honourable Court deems just and equitable.  \[2\] After the service of the writ with its accompanying statement of claim on the Defendants, an appearance was entered and later a joint statement of defence filed on behalf of the Defendants.  ii.The Issues  \[3\] The issues set out in the application for directions which were set down on the 17th day of November, 2016 were as follows;  Whether 1st Defendant assaulted Plaintiff?  Whether 1st Defendant committed battery of Plaintiff?  Whether the 1st Defendant was in the ordinary course of his employment with the 2nd Defendant when he allegedly stabbed Plaintiff causing the injuries she sustained?  Whether the 2nd Defendant is vicariously liable for the acts of 1st Defendant?  Any other issue(s) raised by the pleadings.  All the issues were adopted by the court for determination.  \[4\] At the trial the Plaintiff gave evidence and called no other witness to close her case. The 1st Defendant testified for himself after which one other witness was called to give evidence in support of the Defendants.  iii. The Case of the Plaintiff  \[5\] The Plaintiff’s testimony was in pith and substance in line with her pleading. She testified that her husband Mr. Benjamin Duffuor at all material times was an employee of Bank of Ghana (BoG) as Deputy Manager of Other Financial Institutions Supervision Department and so her family at all material times lived in House No. 2, Flat 3, First Shippi Close at East Cantonment, Accra. She testified that officers of the 2nd Defendant at different times visited the Bank of Ghana flat where she lived with her family three times and the 1st Defendant who is an employee of the 2nd Defendant was part of the officials who visited the house on all the three occasions.  \[6\] The Plaintiff told the Court that on the 3rd occasion when the officials of the 2nd Defendant came the 1st Defendant told her that he had been ordered to remove an installed meter at all costs so he was going to remove the said meter. According to her she pleaded with him but he declined and asked that “why my family were the only ones still in occupation of the property when everyone else had vacated the property”. She said during the conversation “I stood by the meter and then in a bit of time, I saw 1st Defendant coming towards me with a screw driver and a plier in his hands and as he approached me he kept saying “I have to take this meter at all cost”.  \[7\] According to the Plaintiff before she realized 1st Defendant held her by the neck violently, whiles holding the working tools, after which “he pulled my right arm and held my waist in a bid to push me away from where I stood”. She further testified that she came back to stand in front of the meter and the 1st Defendant realizing that she will not move stabbed her wrist very close to her right index finger with the screw driver. According to the Plaintiff during the incident two colleagues of the 1st Defendant were behind the property and they came to the scene when she shouted after she was stabbed. She further testified that the 1st Defendant knowing what he had done asked a colleague to take photographs to show that the Plaintiff was obstructing him in the performance of his duties.  \[8\] The Plaintiff testified that as a result of the injury sustained she first attended hospital and was later referred to a specialist orthopedic surgeon who performed a surgery on her finger. She also testified that she incurred some costs as a result of the injury sustained. She therefore claims against the Defendants and implored the Court to grant her reliefs.  \[9\] The Plaintiff tendered in support of her case, the following exhibits:  i) Exhibit A, A1, A2 – Photographs showing the incident;  ii) Exhibit B – A copy of Police Medical form the Plaintiff used to go to the hospital;  iii) Exhibits C – A copy of X-ray request form, X-ray report and a photograph of the finger;  iv) Exhibits D – A referral letter to a specialist Orthopedic Surgeon at Korle-Bu;  v) Exhibit E – An X-ray photograph dated 17th March, 2016;  vi) Exhibit F and F1 – According to the Plaintiff they are pathological findings at the Ghana Standards Authority showing “masses of tumours”.  vii) Exhibit G, G1, G2 and G3 – Photographs of her finger after surgery;  viii) Exhibit H – Receipts evidencing the costs incurred by the Plaintiff.  iv. The Defendants’ Evidence  \[10\] The 1st Defendant testified that he visited the Bank of Ghana flats where the Plaintiff lived on two occasions. According to him on the first visit he met a gentleman he later got to know to be the Plaintiff’s husband. He testified that on the first visit he did not meet the Plaintiff. He told the Court that he was asked to attend at the house to remove the meters which are the property of the 2nd Defendant at the request of the Bank of Ghana to enable a demolishing exercise to take place. According to the 1st Defendant, the gentleman informed them he was not going to allow them to remove the meters because “he had some issues with his employer already and that this was a plan engaged by his employer to frustrate him”.  \[11\] The 1st Defendant further testified that he called his boss who after talking to the said gentleman asked that they return to the office. He said his boss informed him the gentleman had been given two weeks to resolve whatever issue he had with his employers. He said on that occasion some other meters that were affixed to some flats at the boys-quarters which had no occupancy were removed.  \[12\] The 1st Defendant testified that he attended at the flat almost three weeks later after he was sent in the company of one Yussif Adamu, a Technical Engineer of the 2nd Defendant to remove the other meters. According to him it was to avoid the destruction of the meters since the Bank of Ghana had communicated to them that they intended on going ahead with the demolition. According to the 1st Defendant it was on this visit that he met the Plaintiff. He said the Plaintiff pleaded with them not to remove the meter because it would interrupt the power supply to her home. He said he explained to the Plaintiff that the removal of the meter would not interrupt with the power supply to the house because the entire building had an underground direct connection system but she refused to accept.  \[13\] According to the 1st Defendant he realized that the main reason for the Plaintiff resistance to the removal of the meter had nothing to do with the power supply but because she believed that her husband’s employers were using the 2nd Defendant to frustrate them. The evidence of the 1st Defendant was that the Plaintiff shouted, abused, pushed and shoved him all in the attempt to prevent him from removing the meter. He denied assaulting the Plaintiff and told the Court that he asked a colleague to take the photos of the Plaintiff preventing him from doing his work because of the abuse hurled at him by the Plaintiff. He denied that the meter was not removed and also denied assaulting the Plaintiff. He tendered as Exhibits 1 and 2 being the letter from the dated 7th February, 2013 to request the disconnection of power from its flats and the photographs taken during the incident.  \[14\] Mr. Yusif Adamu testified for the Defendants. He corroborated the 1st Defendant’s testimony to the extent that he was aware that the Bank of Ghana flats located at East Airport were due for demolition and it was the reason why the Bank of Ghana requested the 2nd Defendant as owners of the meters to go and remove them. Mr. Adamu further testified that the 1st Defendant did not touch, assault and/or manhandle the Plaintiff. According to him it was the attitude of the Plaintiff that caused the 1st Defendant to request him to take the photographs of “what was happening as proof of the obstruction to work which is a criminal offence”. In a nutshell he supported the 1st Defendant denial of assault of the Plaintiff.  v. The Evaluation of the Evidence, the Court’s Opinion & Analysis  \[15\] I start my analysis by first stating that the court finds from the evidence on record that the 1st Defendant was in the ordinary course of his duties as an employee of the 2nd Defendant and therefore should the Court find him liable of the allegations, the 2nd Defendant would also be held vicariously liable.  vi. Findings of Fact  \[16\] From the unchallenged evidence, I have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the 1st Defendant as an employee of the 2nd Defendant attended at the Plaintiff’s home to perform an official duty. I also find as a fact that at all material times the Plaintiff was determined to prevent the 1st Defendant from removing the meter which I also find belongs to the 2nd Defendant and not the Bank of Ghana.  \[17\] It is also my finding that the Plaintiff was injured in the course of an altercation between herself and the 1st Defendant. It is also my finding that as a result of the injury sustained the Plaintiff had a surgery and therefore I accept as a fact that the Plaintiff incurred financial cost for the treatment and also on medication.  \[18\] Now, having so found, I hereby consider what in my view is the most important of the issues raised which is whether or not the 1st Defendant assaulted the Plaintiff or in other words is the 1st Defendant liable for the injury sustained by the Plaintiff as a result of the altercation I have found occurred?  \[19\] The general position of the law is that each party to the suit who alleges per their claim must adduce evidence on the facts and issues to be determined by the court to the prescribed standard set by statute Section 14 of the Evidence Act (NRCD 323) 1975 provides.  “Except as otherwise provided by law, unless and until it is shifted, a party has the burden of persuasion as to each fact the existence or non – existence of which is essential to the claim or defence he is asserting”  \[20\] This general position on the burden of proof and of persuasion has had judicial approval by the Supreme Court in the case of ABABIO VRS. AKWASI IV \[1994 – 1995\] GBR 774 where Aikins JSC expounded the position as follows:  “The general principle of law is that it is the duty of a Plaintiff to prove what he alleges. In other words, it is the party who raises in his pleadings an issue essential to the success of his case who assumes the burden of proving it. The burden only shifts to the defence to lead sufficient evidence to tip the scales in his favour when on a particular issue, the Plaintiff leads some evidence to prove his claim. If the Defendant succeeds in doing this he wins, if not, he loses on that particular issue”.  See also the case of RE: ASHALLEY BOTWE LANDS, ADJETEY AGBOSU & OTHERS V. KOTEY & OTHERS \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 420.  \[21\] Counsel for the Plaintiff strongly submitted that the 1st Defendant is guilty of assault based on the law and relied on the old English case READ v. COKER \[1853\] 138 E.R. 2437 and the statement of Jervis CJ that “…if anything short of actual striking will in law constitute an assault, the facts here clearly showed that defendant was guilty of assault. There was a threat of violence exhibiting an intention to assault, and a present ability to carry the threat into execution”. According to Mrs. Fiawoo Exhibit A, A1 and A2 support the case of the Plaintiff’ because the photographs show the first Defendant holding a screw driver which he held in a fist. According to Learned Counsel the presence of the screw driver at the material time shows that the 1st Defendant indeed assaulted the Plaintiff by stabbing her with same. She has therefore urged me to so find.  \[22\] Counsel for the Defendants on the other hand also relied on another old English case titled COLE v. TURNER (1704) 6 Mod. 149 and the statement of the law by Holt C.J. to the effect that “if one man intentionally applies force directly to another, the Plaintiff has a cause of action in assault and battery, or, if you so please to describe it, in trespass to the person. The least touching of another in anger is a battery”. According to Learned Counsel it is imperative for this Court to determine if indeed on a preponderance of probabilities, the Plaintiff suffered direct and intentional application of force by the 1st Defendant or that the 1st Defendant touched her in anger. According to Counsel for the Defendant, based on the law the Plaintiff woefully failed to discharge the burden of proof and therefore I should dismiss the claim.  \[23\] In the instant case, it is clear in my view that for the Plaintiff to succeed in proving her claim that the 1st Defendant assaulted her and in effect establish that he is liable for the injury she sustained she had to prove that the 1st Defendant intentionally applied force directly to her person by using the screw driver to stab her.  \[24\] To my mind it is important for the Court to interrogate the testimony of the Plaintiff in resolving the main issue as the Plaintiff has the onus of proof. As per her evidence in chief she testified per the adopted witness statement as follows from paragraph 19 - 24:  “At that moment, some two men from the neighbourhood came around, and then I saw the three employees of the 2nd Defendant talking amongst them.  All this while I stood by the meter and then in a bit of time, I saw 1st Defendant coming towards me with a screw driver and a plier in his hands and as he approached me, he kept saying “I have to take this meter at all cost”.  Before I realized, 1st Defendant held my neck violently, whiles holding the working tools, after which he pulled my right arm and held my waist in a bid to push me away from where I stood.  I came back to stand in front of the meter; and 1st Defendant realizing that I did not want to leave the place, stabbed me in my right wrist very close to my right index finger with it.  I was in so much pain so I bent down for a while; then he took out a wire from the meter,  whereupon I began to shout and I asked 1st Defendant if he wanted to kill me because of a meter.  Due to my shouting, 1st Defendant’s two other colleagues and the two other neighbours who were behind the property came around; and knowing very well what he had done, 1st Defendant asked his colleagues to take photographs to show that I was obstructing them in the performance of their official duty, which pictures his colleagues did take with their mobile phones. Attached to this witness statement is a copy each of the said photographs as Exhibits A, A1 and A2”.  \[25\] In my view, the above testimony is the crux of the matter. Now, is there any air of reality to the Plaintiff’s testimony above? How possible was it for the 1st Defendant to hold the Plaintiff’s neck violently, while holding his working tools, being the screw driver and a pair of pliers, and at the same time hold her waist to push her away? Of a truth I find it difficult to comprehend and accept. How can a person hold tools, hold a neck and at the same time hold a waist/right arm of another person at the same time with his two hands? With respect to the Plaintiff I do not believe her on this point because it is not consistent with common sense.  \[26\] Again, another aspect of the above evidence which did not make sense is in regards to the photographs. From the above testimony, the impression is created that they were taken after the alleged stabbing but a closer look of the photographs show that there is no indicia of the injury such as blood from the injury and/or any other sign of it. Rather to my mind the photographs represent the struggle between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant and his colleague as she struggled with them to prevent them from removing the meter before and not after the injury. Exhibit “A” clearly shows the Plaintiff’s right hand holding onto the left hand of the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant’s right hand is holding a screw driver which is pointing downwards and in no harm’s way of the Plaintiff. The look on the face of the Plaintiff shows she is either shouting or talking while the 1st Defendant is smiling. There is a similar struggle between two men and the Plaintiff in Exhibit A2 as well. To my mind the photographs to do not support the Plaintiff’s allegations at all.  \[27\] It is clear from what unfolded as depicted in the exhibits referenced above that the Plaintiff was determined to prevent the 1st Defendant and his colleague from removing the meter similar to what she pleaded in paragraph 15 of her statement of claim, wherein she pleaded that on November 11, 2013 she prevented the 2nd Defendant’ employees from removing the meter so they left. I therefore have no doubt in my mind that on this occasion as well she was the aggressor and not the 1st Defendant.  \[28\] I therefore hold that the Plaintiff sustained the injury as a result of her struggle with the 1st Defendant who was holding the tools he use to work. I am not convinced that the 1st Defendant applied force intentionally to injure the Plaintiff. Based on the evidence I am not convinced that the Plaintiff has proved her case on the balance of probabilities to entitle her to the claims she seeks. Examining the Plaintiff’s testimony in the light of its internal consistency and its consonance with the other evidence heard and before the Court and with the probabilities inherent in the circumstances, it is my judgment that the Plaintiff’s evidence led is not worthy of any credit and I do not believe her. I found that the Plaintiff was often evasive and some of her answers with respect did not make sense.  \[29\] One instance where the Plaintiff’s testimony was given to protect her own interest is as captured in her cross-examination by the Defendant’s Counsel on May 9, 2017. Below is a reproduction in part of the exchange between Counsel for the Defendant and the Plaintiff during cross-examination of the Plaintiff:  “Q: I refer you to your Exhibit “A”, are you not holding the hand of the 1 Defendant in that picture?  A: No is just touching it.  Q: I refer you to Exhibit “A1” and the Defendant proposed Exhibit “2A”, are you not still seen holding the hand of the 1st Defendant?  A: No  Q: Have a look at your Exhibit “A2” which is Defendant’s proposed Exhibit “2B”, doesn’t this picture also depict you holding the hand of the 1st Defendant to prevent him from removing the meter?  A: No my hands are on my chest, you can only see my elbow you can’t see the rest.  Q: so it is your case that at no particular time did you try preventing the Defendant from removing the meter?  A: I did but I didn’t hold him.  Q: And how did you do that?  A: I was standing in front of him raising my hand to prevent him from taking the meter.  \[30\] On June 2, 2017 whilst testifying in regards to the medical reports tendered the following as ensued between the Plaintiff and Counsel for the Defendants.  “Q: Exhibit “B” further says that you were treated and discharged is that not so?  A: Yes  Q: So you want this Court to believe that two years after you were treated and discharged you developed a growth which can still be linked to the incidence of 28th of November, 2013?  A: Yes  Q: Do you agree with me that during that period of two years anything could have happened that could have resulted in growth of tumours in your finger?  A: That is not true. The same place I had the problem is the same place I continue to have the problem.  Q: Did you bother to ask your doctors what could lead or cause giant cell tumour?  A: Yes  Q: And what did your doctor tell you?  A: It can be an injury caused by violence.  Q: Did your doctor add that it could also be naturally occurring?  A: They only explained to me what caused my own?  Q: So the doctor gave you the impression that there was only one cause to this condition is that what you are telling the Court.  A: Because I was interested in my case so he explained to me what caused my problem….  Q: You told this Court at paragraph 30 of your witness statement that the radiologist said there is a hole in the bone of your index finger. Can you show this Court where in Exhibit “C1” this information by the radiologist can be found?  A: Exhibit C1 first paragraph and the last but one  Q: Can you read the paragraphs you have identified to the Court?  A: Witness reads to open Court  Q: Do you know the meaning of what you just read?  A: I know is a medical term but it was explained to me that is a hole…  Q: Take a look at Exhibit C1 that report says at the second line, “No fracture seen” is that not more of a description of non-existence of a hole in your finger?  A: Fracture is a different from a hole”.  \[31\] Clearly, from the above discourse it is clear that the Plaintiff’s answers were given with her own interest in mind. Without doubt, the Plaintiff’s own evidence to the Court, in relation to the photographs and the medical reports clearly demonstrate that Ms. Ayimah was economical with the truth. On the whole, I was not impressed with her testimony on the key parts of the evidence. I assessed her as a witness who was selective as to what she was prepared to tell the Court and admit. She did not present herself as a witness who was being entirely candid. Her testimony was given with a view to her own interest rather than in accordance with the oath which she had taken.  \[32\] I wish to state that my above findings against the Plaintiff should not in any way shape or form be interpreted that the 1st Defendant who testified was a credible witness. In my respectful opinion, the main actors in this case, being the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant as witnesses demonstrated serious credibility shortcomings, but it is trite that the Plaintiff wins her case based on how she discharges the onus placed on her before same could be shifted unto the Defendant, in other words on the merits of her case and not the weakness of the Defendant’s case. In this case I am of the respectful view that the Plaintiff has failed.  \[33\] Having reviewed the evidence and the record before me, even though I am troubled by the injury the Plaintiff sustained as a result of what happened, I find that she is not entitled to any of her claims and thus dismiss the Plaintiffs claim. Now, having found that the 1st Defendant is not liable for assaulting the Plaintiff based on the facts of this case and the law and thus cannot in law be held liable for the Plaintiff’s injury, I also find that the 2nd Defendant cannot be vicariously responsible for anything.  Conclusion and Disposition:  \[34\] Before I sign off I wish to state that I am troubled by the facts and the circumstance of this case and what obviously led to this unfortunate injury of the Plaintiff. Indeed if the Plaintiff and the husband truly believed that the Bank of Ghana was using the 2nd Defendant as a surrogate to do their bidding of getting them off the property at East Cantonment why did they not go to Court to stop the 2nd Defendant from coming over to the flat to remove the meter which undoubtedly was its property? To be blunt the Plaintiff’s approach in this case with respect was not wise. To take the law into her own hands to prevent the officers of the 2nd Defendant was dangerous and unacceptable.  \[35\] Her behavior to my mind raises a supplemental question which is whether or not this Court should endorse such an approach where a citizen of this Republic is allowed to take the law into his or her hands to prevent another from performing his lawful official duty when there is no legal injunction or impediment under the guise of protecting “his space”; and if an injury occurs as in this case the same belligerent person then comes to the Court to seek damages. To my mind the Court should not endorse such a behavior because that would potentially render our society to the dynamics of a Hobbesian state of anarchy and chaos.  \[36\] Finally, I am grateful to both Counsel for their assistance. They represented their clients with candour and respect for each other and I was impressed. On Cost I am inclined to say the parties should bear their cost because of the circumstances of this case.  Ordered accordingly.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'GJ 991/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ANNIE EMEFA FIAWOO (MRS.)

"JUDGEMENT  Introduction:  (1). This action arises from a motor vehicle collision which took place on December 20, 2010 at ACP Junction, Pokuase. The collision involved a Benz 207 Bus with Registration Number GR 3817 T and owned by Adjuik Yakubu, the Plaintiff herein and a Kia Rhino vehicle with Registration Number AS 8471-10 said to be owned by the Defendant, Pro-Credit Savings and Loan Company Limited. One Akosah Kwadwo of Techiman was operating the Kia Rhino vehicle which was loaded with salt from Accra to Techiman at the time of the collision. The collision resulted in the injury to about eighteen passengers who were on board the Benz 207 Bus. The injured were evacuated to the 37 Military Hospital for treatment.  (2). On January 23, 2011 the driver of the Kia Rhino vehicle, Akosah Kwadwo was charged by the Police and arraigned before the Amasaman District Court. According to the police accident report “he pleaded guilty to all the counts and was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of GH¢840.00 in default four (4) months I.H.L. Fine paid vide Judicial Service receipt No. 4806067 dated 25/01/2011”.  (3) Consequently, the Plaintiff commenced this action initially in 2011 and amended same on July 6, 2012. Further to leave granted by this Court in 2017 the Plaintiff abandoned some of the initial reliefs and now claims against the Defendant the following judicial reliefs:  i) An order for the Replacement of Plaintiff’s vehicle with an imported unregistered Sprinter Benz as Plaintiff’s vehicle is out of production.  ii) Recovery of 500 days loss of earnings at GH¢40.00 per day while the said vehicle was parked for repairs.  The Pleadings:  (4) The Plaintiff’s case as by the Amended Statement of Claim is that he is the owner of a 207 Commercial Benz Bus with Registration No. 3817 T which provided the Plaintiff with a supplementary income. The Plaintiff further pleaded that the Defendant is a limited liability Company registered under the laws of the Republic of Ghana carrying on the business of banking and the provision of allied banking services. According to the Plaintiff the Defendant is now known as Fidelity Bank located at Ridge in Accra.  (5) The Plaintiff further pleaded that the Defendant admitted ownership of the Kia Rhino truck with registration No. AS 8471-10 which caused the damage to the Plaintiff’s vehicle and injured some passengers who were on board. It is the case of the Plaintiff that the driver of the Kia Vehicle, Akosah Kwadwo “negligently ran into and badly damaged Plaintiff’s 207 Benz Bus with registration No. GR 3817 T, on 20/12/2010 at ACP Junction, Pokuase”. It is the further case of the Plaintiff that in addition to the physical damage to the Plaintiff’s bus, 18 fare paying passengers on the Plaintiff’s vehicle suffered various injuries. Plaintiff further averred that the driver, Akosah Kwadwo was charged and was arraigned before the District Magistrate Court, Amasaman and he pled guilty to the charges, was convicted on his own plea and fined, which fine he paid.  (6) The Plaintiff further pleaded that the “Defendant’s vehicle as a result of the accident has caused loss and damage to Plaintiff Vehicle which has remained at the workshop till date, and has completely rotten down and is beyond salvage”. The Plaintiff provided the particulars of the damage and the loss as per the writ of summons. The Plaintiff further averred that “by a letter dated 22nd March, 2012 the Plaintiff instructed his lawyers to demand from Defendant the cost of repairs and 600 days loss of use which was calculated at GH¢40 per day at the time of filing writ in 2011”.  (7) The Plaintiff further averred that the Defendant is vicariously liable for the damage and loss caused to the Plaintiff’s Vehicle and Plaintiff’s subsequent loss of income from the use of the vehicle. According to the Plaintiff the writ of summons was amended and filed on 6th July, 2012 after discovering the Defendant as owners of the vehicle which damaged his vehicle. The Plaintiff further pleaded that the matter delayed unduly because the Plaintiff believed that the Defendant after filing the entry of appearance did not file the necessary processes timeously. The Plaintiff further pleaded that after many years of delay the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff a letter on a “without prejudice” basis through their lawyer “seeking settlement out of court dated 3/2/2017; suffice to say the attempt at settlement failed”. The Plaintiff’s further pleading was that “at all material times the long delays were occasioned by the Defendant who instructed his solicitor to serve on Plaintiff a letter proposing settlement; and this dragged the case further, requiring filing for default judgement to no avail”  (8) The Plaintiff again pleaded that the Defendant having “voluntarily admitted ownership of the vehicle under their own signature, on or about 7/2/2012; and same fact earlier stated by a Police Accident Report dated 21/02/2011, the Defendant nevertheless found different ploys to drag out the case, including filing of motions 13/01/2012 that it should be misjoined; and other technicalities that should not be entertained”.  (9) The Plaintiff further pleaded that “Plaintiff realized his great loss if he remained stuck to the estimates or reliefs of the suit in 2011; and sought leave to amend his Witness Statement earlier filed. This was granted and Plaintiff filed a fresh Witness Statement on 14-12-2016 and sought, by the exigencies of the situation, the demand for a replacement vehicle worth in December 2016 GH¢60,000.00 by reason that the original relief for repair was inoperable because the Plaintiff’s vehicle was no longer repairable, having rotten down sitting in one place for 6 years. This was without leave of court, hence the leave sought formally and granted”. The Plaintiff also pleaded that “Plaintiff, in addition to seeking a replacement, would also mitigate the cost to Defendant whereby Plaintiff will maintain the loss of earning at the same rate in 2011 of 40 Ghana Cedis (GH¢40) per day and also reduce the SIX YEARS loss of use to only 600 DAYS”  (10) The Defendant has denied Plaintiff’s Claim. By the Statement of Defence filed on February 3, 2016, the Defendant denies paragraph 3 to 11 of the Plaintiff’s Amended Statement of Claim and pleaded that the Plaintiff shall be put to strict proof of those averments. The Defendant pleaded at paragraph 5 of the Statement of Defence that at all material times the Defendant did not exercise any control over the driver. According to the Defendant “its interest in the vehicle with registration number AS 8417-10 is strictly limited to the amount of money advanced to the user of the vehicle for which the vehicle was used as collateral to secure the facility”.  (11) Based on the above the Defendant pleaded “it is not liable for any tort committed by or under the authority of the driver or client of the Defendant who at all materials times had control and possession of the vehicle. Based on all of the above the Defendant pleaded that Plaintiff is not entitled to her claim.  (12) The Plaintiff filed a reply on May 6, 2016 to respond to the Statement of Defence filed and basically denied all of the Defendant’s averments and repeated his averments and joined issues with the Defendant on its Statement of Defence.  Issues for Trial  (13) At the close of the pleadings the issues contained in the Application for Directions filed by the Plaintiff on June 30, 2016 and the Additional Issues filed by the Defendant on July 12, 2016 and adopted by the court for trial were:-  a) Whether or not Defendant’s vehicle with registration number AS 8471-10 caused damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle?  b) Whether or not the Plaintiff has suffered damage and loss arising from the damage complained above.  c) Whether or not the Plaintiff is entitled to his reliefs in their entirety.  d) Any other issues raised in the pleadings.  The Additional Issues filed were as follows:  1\. Whether or not the Defendant is vicariously liable for the torts of the user of the vehicle with registration number AS84417-10.  2\. Whether or not the Defendant exercised control and possession over the use of the vehicle with registration number AS84417-10.  Determination of the Issues by the Court  (14) The issues set down for determination above notwithstanding, after hearing the evidence, the issues that have become pertinent are the identity and capacity of the Plaintiff to institute the action and the two additional issues above. In my view the determination of those issues will no doubt effectively determine the dispute between the parties. This is because based on the evidence heard I note that the Defendant did not contest the circumstances of the accident and the damage to the Plaintiff’s vehicle, as well as the allegations of negligence of the driver Akosa Kwadwo because it took the position that the driver was not its employee or agent and therefore not liable for his alleged negligence.  (15) The law is trite that a party who asserts a fact assumes the responsibility of proving same. The burden of producing evidence as well as the burden of persuasion is therefore cast on that party and the standard required is provided for by virtue of sections 10,11 and 12 of the Evidence Act 1975 \[NRCD 323). The Court notes that the stated provisions have received judicial blessing as the Supreme Court has pronounced on them in the past to be the nature and standard of proof in civil cases.  (16) One of such decisions is the case of ABABIO VRS. AKWASI IV \[1994 – 1995\] GBR 774 where Aikins JSC expounded the position as follows:  “The general principle of law is that it is the duty of a Plaintiff to prove what he alleges. In other words, it is the party who raises in his pleadings an issue essential to the success of his case who assumes the burden of proving it. The burden only shifts to the defence to lead sufficient evidence to tip the scales in his favour when on a particular issue, the Plaintiff leads some evidence to prove his claim. If the Defendant succeeds in doing this he wins, if not, he loses on that particular issue”.  (17) By the above statement of the law Aikins JSC reiterated the position of Kpegah JA. (as he then was) in ZABRAMA V. SEGBEDZI. \[1991\] 2GLR 221. Further, the Supreme Court reiterated the principle that the party who asserts has the burden of proof in the case of ACKAH V. PERGAH TRANSPORT LTD & ORS \[2010\] SCGLR 728 where in unanimously dismissing an appeal, the  Supreme Court held inter alia as follows:  “It is a basic principle of the law on evidence that a party who bears the burden of proof is to produce the required evidence of the facts in issue that has the quality of credibility short of which his claim may fail. The method of producing evidence is varied and it includes the testimonies of the party and material witnesses, admissible hearsay, documentary and things (often described as real evidence), without which the party might not succeed to establish the requisite degree of credibility concerning a fact in the mind of the court or tribunal of fact such as a jury. It is trite law that matters that are capable of proof must be proved by producing evidence so that on all the evidence a reasonable mind could conclude that the existence of the fact is more reasonable than its non-existence. This is a requirement of the law on evidence under sections 10(1) and (2) and 11(1) and (4) of the Evidence Act, 1975 (NRCD 323).”  The Plaintiff’s Evidence:  (18) The Plaintiff’s case consisted of his testimony in court and the documentary evidence he submitted in support of his claim, marked in the record as Exhibits “A” to “D”. Mr. Yakubu testified based on the Amended Witness Statement filed on 14-12-2016 and adopted at trial that he is the owner of the 207 Commercial Benz Bus with registration number GR 3817 T. He testified that his vehicle was destroyed by the Defendant’s Kia Rhino Truck with registration number AS 8471-10 on December 20, 2010 which was negligently driven into his 207 Benz vehicle at ACP Junction at Pokuase. According to the Plaintiff the Defendant admitted its ownership of the Kia Rhino Truck by a letter dated February 7, 2012. Mr. Yakubu tendered as Exhibit “A” a copy of the said letter.  (19) Mr. Yakubu further testified that the Defendant’s Kia vehicle’s driver was one Akosah Kwadwo as per the Police Accident Report confirms. Mr. Yakubu further testified that the police who investigated the incident charged the driver. According to him the driver was prosecuted and convicted on his own plea and sentenced to a fine of GH¢840 or in default four (4) months I.H.L. A copy of the police accident report was tendered at trial as Exhibit “B”.  (20) According to the Plaintiff by a letter dated 22nd March, 2012, “I instructed my lawyers to demand form Defendant the cost of repairs and only 60 days’ loss of use which was calculated at GH¢40 per day, amounting in all to GH¢9,269.00” A copy of the letter was tendered as Exhibit “C” at trial. According to the Plaintiff the Defendant has resisted all his requests to have the matter settled even though their former Counsel, Lawyer Acheampong on February 4, 2013 served on his lawyer an offer to settle. A copy of that letter was tendered as Exhibit “D” at trial. According to the Plaintiff despite being happy at the prospects of settling the matter nothing came out of it and he later he found out that “the Defendant’s gesture was another act of insincerity to deepen his woes” and also because Mr. Acheampong ceased to work for the Defendant.  (21) Mr. Yakubu further testified that “on the whole the Defendant has demonstrated a lack of humanity in dealing with my issue and that it is only the Honourable Court that can, and must come to my rescue and save me from the suffering created by the Defendant to impoverish me”. He therefore prayed the Court to grant his reliefs.  The Defendant’s Evidence:  (22) The Defendant’s evidence at trial was given by one Kingsley Appiah, a Senior Legal Assistant of Fidelity Bank Ghana Limited which has now acquired the Defendant Company. Mr. Appiah testified that because the instant suit was commenced in the year 2011, all staff of the Defendant who had personal knowledge of the events averred in the pleadings have resigned and therefore he was called upon as the Senior Legal Assistant in charge of vehicle documentations to testify on behalf of the Defendant.  (23) The Defendant’s witness testified that the Defendant granted a loan facility of GH¢28,000 to one Samuel Adjei and he used same to purchase a Kia Rhino truck with registration number AS 8471-10. According to Mr. Adjei based on their agreement the truck was used as collateral security for the loan. Mr. Appiah further testified and conceded that the said truck was being driven by one Akosa Kwadwo at the time of the accident, however he said ”the said Akosa Kwadwo has never been a staff, agent or assign of the Defendant” but rather was the agent of Samuel Adjei, the borrower at all material times”.  (24) Mr. Adjei further testified and conceded that by a letter dated 25th January, 2012, the Plaintiff’s counsel wrote to Defendant requesting confirmation of ownership of the Kia Rhino with registration number AS 8471-10 whereupon Defendant’s Legal Officers, by a letter dated 7th February, 2012 confirmed ownership of the said vehicle.  (25) Mr. Appiah further testified that that at all material times, Akosa Kwadwo was the agent of Samuel Adjei and was operating the vehicle for and on behalf of Samuel Adjei. Further, the witness testified that the “Defendant does not know the said Akosa Kwadwo, nor has the said Akosa Kwadwo been or held out to be an employee, agent, assign or representative of the Defendant. He also said the Defendant had no say in the engagement of Akosa Kwadwo as driver of the vehicle. Defendant did not exercise any control and possession whatsoever over the said vehicle. As a result, according to the witness the “Defendant’s interest in the said vehicle is only to secure their financial interest by ensuring that its name was on the vehicle documents”.  (26) Finally, Mr. Appiah testified that “any loss which may have been suffered by Plaintiff, while it is unfortunate, it is not the fault of the Defendant or any of its agents, assigns, representatives or persons claiming through the Defendant”. Mr. Appiah said the “Plaintiff sat unconcerned while Akosa Kwadwo and Samuel Adjei removed themselves from this suit and out of ill-will joined Defendant to the suit because Defendant is a Bank and stands in a better financial position compared with Akosa Kwadwo and Samuel Adjei.” He said this whole suit is “actuated by bad faith and it is an obvious ploy to visit the Plaintiff’s frustrations on the Defendant”. He therefore urged the Court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim.  The issue about the Identity and Capacity of the Plaintiff:  (27) In the course of the trial one thorny issue that emerged was the identity of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff who sued is called “Adjuik Yakubu”. The police accident report which was tendered as Exhibit “B” and which the Plaintiff relies on to identify himself as the owner of the 207 Benz Bus states the owner is “Adjei Yakubu”. The same name also appears on the vehicle registration certificate. In the course of the trial Counsel for the Defendant raised an objection to the identity of the Plaintiff and his capacity to institute the action on the grounds that the Plaintiff has failed to explain with cogent evidence why the difference in the name of “Adjuik Yakubu” and “Adjei Yakubu”. The Plaintiff said it was only a mistake on the part of the police officer who prepared the police accident report.  (28) In an effort to explain the discrepancy in the name, the Plaintiff’s Counsel subpoenaed one Inspector Bernette Ayertey Tetteh, the police officer who prepared the police accident report. The Police Office testified as a Court Witness (CW1) and said he was an inspector with the Ghana Police Service attached to the MTTD Unit at Amasaman. He stated that on 20th December 2010 an accident case was reported and it was referred to him for investigation. He also said he undertook the investigation and took statements from the drivers of the vehicles. According to him in the course of the investigation he realized that the insurance certificate bore the name of Adjuik Yakubu but the DVLA registration was Adjei Yakubu. He identified the police report as the one he authored.  (29) Under cross-examination by learned counsel for Plaintiff, CW1 stated that in the preparation of the police report, he relied on the drivers’ licenses insurance and road worthy certificates. He noted that the insurance certificate bore the name Adjuik Yakubu whiles the road worthy certificate bore the name Adjei Yakubu. Upon seeing this discrepancy, CW1 stated that he requested the Plaintiff to furnish him with documents to confirm his ownership. CW1 also identified two DVLA Form C documents. One issued in 2010 and one issued in 2011 with the names Adjei Yakubu and Adjuik Yakubu respectively. Based on the documents, he explained that the name Adjei Yakubu was a typographical mistake. He further stated that upon examination and inspection by DVLA, the 2010 pink Form C was the correct Form C and that it bore the real name of the Plaintiff as Adjuik Yakubu.  (30) Under cross examination by the Defendant’s counsel the following evidence was elicited  “Q. You have stated before this Honourable Court that Exhibit “A” of the subpoena which is the police accident report has the name Adjei K. Yakubu, am I correct?  A. Yes, my lord  Q. You have also stated that this is a typing error before this honourable Court?  A. Yes, my lord  Q. Where do you suppose this error emanated from?  A. My Lord from the typing.  Q. Take a look at Exhibit “D” attached to the subpoena, which is the blue DVLA vehicle registration certificate and tell the court the name of the owner of the vehicle as stated therein?  A. Adjei Yakubu.  Q. If you could state it as exactly written, please?  A. My Lord that one is Adjei Yakubu.  Q. I am suggesting to you that the name written here is Mr. Adjei K. Yakubu?  A. Yes, my Lord.  Q. You would agree with me that this is exactly the same name written on Exhibit “A”, i.e. the police report.  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. I am therefore suggesting to you that the source of the error patent on the face of the police report is Exhibit “D”.  A. Exhibit “D” bearing Adjei Yakubu whiles the police report bearing Adjei K. Yakubu.  Q. Take a look at Exhibit “A” one more time and indicate to this Court anything on the face of this report which indicate that you are the author of this report.  A. Yes, my Lord.  Q. You made this statement based on the comparison you made between two vehicle registration certificates issued by the DVLA, am I correct?  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. You had stated before this Honourable Court that the proper owner is Adjuik Yakubu.  A. Yes, my Lord.  Q. Are you the author of these two vehicle registration certificates, i.e. Exhibits “C” and “D”?  A. My Lord I am not the author but the Form C and the change of ownership proof that Adjuik Yakubu is the owner of the vehicle.  Q. Does Exhibit “D” also not emanates for the DVLA?  A. Exhibit “D” has no record from the DVLA but Form C and the change of ownership.  Q. I am suggesting to you that both Exhibits “C” and “D” emanate from the DVLA.  A. Yes, my Lord  Q. You have also stated that you are not an official of the DVLA, is that correct?  A. Yes, my Lord  Q. I am suggesting to you that it does not lie in your mouth to tell this Honourable Court that Exhibit “C” bears the correct name of the Plaintiff as opposed to Exhibit “D”  A. My Lord Exhibit “C” has a record from DVLA while Exhibit “D” has no record from DVLA.  Q. Can you reveal the identities of the personnel of DVLA with whom you carried your checks?  A. My Lord, I can.  Q. I am suggesting to you that everything you have told this Honourable Court is not within you purview as an MTTD Officer but rather within the purview of the DVLA.  A. My Lord we have been mandated to cross check anything that we are in doubt of with the DVLA.  Q. Finally, I am suggesting to you that you are not the proper person to speak to any discrepancies on the face of document emanating from the DVLA.  A. My Lord, as an Inspector of Police, I have the mandate to verify anything whether fake or original form the DVLA.  Q. I am suggesting to you that you cannot determine between exhibit “C” and “D” which one is genuine and which one is fake.  A. My Lord I can, because even driving license when we suspect it is fake, we write to the DVLA”.  (31) Further to the above exchange, Counsel in his written legal submission to the Court stated that “The Plaintiff’s identity and capacity have been called into question because the Plaintiff himself has tendered vehicle registration certificates (Exhibits C and D) before the Honourable Court bearing two different names i.e. Adjei Yakubu and Adjuik Yakubu, each purporting to emanate from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA). These are the documents which were tendered to attempt to prove Plaintiff’s capacity as owner of the vehicle against whom an alleged tort has been committed. Plaintiff’s capacity to institute the action against the Defendant is premised on his identity as the owner of the vehicle in respect of which the alleged tort was committed”.  (32) Counsel continued after analysing the evidence of Police Officer Tetteh that “It is our humble opinion that the proper persons to testify to this inconsistency would be the DVLA as both Exhibits C and D emanate from DVLA and are known to be in the custody of DVLA. CW1 offered no explanation as to the inconsistency. Plaintiff and his Counsel also offered nothing by way of evidence to prove the identity and capacity of the Plaintiff as owner of the vehicle involved in the alleged tort. It is our opinion that having alleged to be the bona fide owner of the vehicle, the burden of proof was on Plaintiff to prove his identity and capacity as owner of the vehicle involved in the alleged tort”.  (33) Having looked at the entire evidence together with all of the documents filed by the parties I am of the respectful opinion that learned Counsel for the Defendant’s submission is anchored on legal technicality and not the reality of the evidence. Without doubt the settled rule of law is that the capacity of a party to mount an action may be challenged at any time, and even on appeal. The case, YORKWA v DUAH (1992-93) GBR 278 C/A illustrates the principle that where a person’s capacity to initiate an action was in issue it is no answer to give him a hearing on its merits even if he had a cast-iron case. See also the Supreme Court case of FOSUA & ADU-POKU v. DUFIE (Deceased) & ADU-POKU MENSAH \[2009\] SCGLR 310 where His Lordship Dotse JSC opined that “Want of capacity is a point of law which, if raised, goes to the root of the action”.  (34) Based on the facts of this case, I am of the view that the explanation offered by the Police Officer is plausible, reasonable and acceptable. From the facts the Defendant cannot point to any known and existing person called “Adjei Yakubu” who is connected to the case at bar except the Plaintiff herein. While indeed, an officer from the DVLA’s appearance in Court to speak to the issue may have been the best option, in my opinion their non-appearance is also not fatal based on the facts. I accept as proper the testimony of Inspector Bernard Ayertey Tetteh on the issue. I also accept as a fact that the actions taken by him as part of his official duty are supportable in law as same is covered under Section 37 of the Evidence Act. Based on the law therefore, I am satisfied that the discrepancy in the name of the Plaintiff as appears on Exhibits “C” and “D” was explained away by CW1 as a clear case of a typographical error and I therefore hold that the Plaintiff’s capacity has been established based on the evidence and the law. The Defendant’s objection is overruled.  (35) As stated above the next important issue (s) to consider are the additional issues, which are:  1\. Whether or not the Defendant is vicariously liable for the torts of the user of the vehicle with registration number AS84417-10.  2\. Whether or not the Defendant exercised control and possession over the use of the vehicle with registration number AS84417-10.  (36) Black’s Law dictionary defines vicarious liability as liability that a supervisory party (such an employer) bears for the actionable conduct of a subordinate or associate (such as an employee) based on the relationship between the two parties. This liability is based on the principle of “respondeat superior.” Thus employers are vicariously liable for the negligent acts or omissions by their employees in the course of their employment. The principle was duly explained by Lord Nicholls in the case of Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam (2002) 3 WLR 1913. He opined that, “The underlying legal policy is based on the recognition that carrying on a business enterprise necessarily involves risk to others. It involves the risk that others will be harmed by wrongful acts committed by the agents through whom the business is carried on. When those risks ripen into loss, it is just that the business should be responsible for compensating the person who has been wronged.” In establishing vicarious liability, three primary requirements must be met. There must be a relationship of control; a tortious act and the act must be done in the course of employment.  (37) The law is that for an employer to be vicariously liable, there must be a requisite relationship between the employer and the tortfeasor. Thus the tortfeasor must be an employee of the employer. See .Bramwell LJ in the case of YEWEN v NOAKES (1880) 6 QBD 530 and his elucidation of the law as to who an employee is.  (38) In this case as stated above the Plaintiff has sued the Defendant on the sole ground that it is the owner of the vehicle that damaged his Benz 209 bus and therefore liable for the damage suffered as a result of the accident. The evidence shows that the Plaintiff initially brought the action against the driver and the company which insured the vehicle but discontinued the action and then instituted the present action. It is pertinent to re-state and reiterate what happened when the Plaintiff was cross-examined by the Defendant’s Counsel on March 19, 2018:  “Q: Do you know one Star Assurance Company Limited?  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. In this same case, on the 13th of January, 2012 you filed an application to join the Defendant in this suit, is that not so?  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. Do you recall that you sued Star Assurance Company Limited and Akosah Kwodwo whom you identified as the driver of the vehicle.  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. What became of the said Akosah Kwadwo, where is he now?  A. My Lord I do not know where he is.  Q. Per Exhibit “B” attached to your own Witness statement, i.e. the police report, Star Assurance is listed as the insurers of the vehicle in question.  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. So you would agree with me that Star Assurance Company should have been properly made the Defendant in this matter?  A. No, my Lord.  Q. Is it the case that you discontinued against Star Assurance and Akosah Kwadwo?  A. Yes, my Lord it is true, I discontinued for certain reasons.  Q. Kindly tell this Court, what your reason was for discontinuing against the insurer of this vehicle?  A. My Lord when the car was involved in an accident I did not know that it is the property of Procredit, so I sued the driver and later he told me that he is just a driver and he is not the owner of the vehicle. He told me that the vehicle has been insured with Star Assurance so I should go to their Circle Office, the office tossed me about until they said that the vehicle belongs to somebody else and so I should sue the owner. We sued Star Assurance and they came to Court. When Star assurance came to Court, they said Procredit is the owner of the vehicle and therefore until we sue Procredit, they cannot pay any money to me.  Q. Is it your case that the driver (Akosah Kwadwo) you spoke with was an agent of Procredit?  A. My Lord I do not know.  Q. I am suggesting to you that the said Akosah Kwadwo was never an agent of the Defendant.  A. My Lord the representative for Procredit testified in Court that the vehicle was purchased for Akosah Kwadwo to be used as ‘work and pay’ and the Court asked in whose name was the vehicle registered and he said it was Procredit who registered the vehicle in their name.  Q. So, by ‘work and pay’, you will agree with me that the Defendant financed the said vehicle?  A. My Lord that statement was made by a representative of Procredit in Court and the Judge said nobody asked them to go and engage themselves in that business and that if they financed the purchase and the vehicle is registered in their name, then they are the right people to be sued as owners.  Q. Is it your case that the Defendant retained control over the said vehicle?  A. Yes my Lord, it is their property.  Q. Is it your case that the Defendant had any say in the engagement of Akosah Kwadwo as  the driver of the said vehicle?  A. Yes, they engaged the said Akosah Kwadwo.  Q. You have said in one breath that Procredit purchased the vehicle for Akosah on a ‘work and pay’ basis, is that not correct?  A. Yes my Lord.  Q. Thereafter, are you telling this Court that Procredit engaged the said Akosah as a driver?  A. Yes, my Lord.  Q. I am suggesting to you that Procredit merely financed the said vehicle and at no time did it engage Akosah as the driver.  A. My Lord after the accident, the police investigation report indicated Procredit to be the registered owner of the vehicle and that is why I said what I said earlier.  Q. I am suggesting to you further that you discontinued against Star Assurance and proceeded against Procredit simply to enrich yourself.  A. No, my Lord.  Q. I am suggesting to you again that you joined Procredit and discontinued against Akosah Kwadwo merely because Procredit was the registered name of the vehicle document and not because Procredit exercised any control over the driver.  A. My Lord the name that was used to register the vehicle is what I proceeded against because my vehicle is destroyed.  Q. When your vehicle is involved in an accident with another vehicle, do you not proceed against the insurer?  A. No my Lord.  Q. I am suggesting to you that your action against the Defendant is brought out of ill-will and solely to enrich yourself.  A. My Lord that is not so”.  (39) From the above exchange it is clear that even though the Plaintiff prevaricated and indeed contradicted himself on the issue whether the said Akosah Kwadwo was the Defendant’s agent he nevertheless said the Defendant is liable for the acts of the driver because it is the owner of the vehicle. His counsel in his submission reiterated the same point. Before I consider Counsel’s submission, it is also important to state that from the record the Plaintiff’s action is anchored in Exhibit “A” and nothing more. I produce here below the said letter. It states:  “ATTENTION: PETER KWAKU NTI ESQ  RE: OWNERSHIP OF KIA RHINO TRUCK REG. NO. AS 8471-10 INSURED – STAR ASSURANCE CO.LTD  POLICY NO. 00863356 ISSUED ON 09/12/2010 TO EXPIRE ON 08/12/2011  We refer to your letter dated 25th January 2012 with the above heading. We hereby confirm ownership of the above mentioned vehicle.  However, we would be grateful if you could give us more information regarding your inquiry.  We await your response.  Yours faithfully  Signed Signed  SOPHIA ADARKWA (MRS) ELIZABETH BOAKYE  SENIOR LEGAL OFFICER LEGAL OFFICER”  (40) As stated earlier, the above letter is the foundational basis for the Plaintiff’s claim. Relying on the above letter as the basis of the liability, the Plaintiff says having acknowledged the ownership of the vehicle the Defendant Company is the employer of Akosah Kwadwo, the driver of the Kia Rhino Truck with registration number AS 8471- 10 which caused damage to the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Plaintiff also relies on the fact that the driver pleaded guilty at the District Court to say the Defendant is liable for the acts of the driver.  (41) On the other hand, the Defendant’s witness Kinglsey Adjei, Senior Legal Assistant testified that his outfit granted a loan facility of GH¢ 28,000 to one Samuel Adjei and used a Kia Rhino Truck as collateral security for the vehicle. He further testified that the driver, Akosah Kwadwo has never been a staff, agent or assign of the Defendant. He stated that Akosah Kwadwo was the agent of Samuel Adjei at all material times. Mr. Adjei conceded that by Exhibit “A” the Defendant’s acknowledged ownership of the vehicle but also said at all material times, the control and use of the vehicle was vested in Samuel Adjei in whose name and for whose benefit the loan facility was granted and for whose benefit the vehicle was being driven. That at all material times Akosah Kwadwo was the agent of Samuel Adjei and not the Defendant herein which does not know the said Akosah Kwadwo, nor has held him up to be its employee, agent, assign or representative.  (42) Mr. Nti in his submission cited the case of KOBINA AND ANOTHER v. BADU \[1968\] GLR 1150-1156, a decision of Aboagye J, sitting at the High Court, Sekondi to state that where a Plaintiff in an action for negligence proved that damage had been caused by the Defendant’s motor car the fact of ownership of the motor car was, prima facie evidence that the motor car at the material time, was driven by the owner or his agent or servant in the course of his employment”. Counsel also cited other cases to say that the Defendant is vicariously liable.  (43) Having critically reviewed all of the evidence I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s action fails based on the following reasons stated below. First and foremost, I am of the respectful view that Counsel for the Plaintiff has misconceived the law as articulated by Aboagye J. Respectfully, I do not agree with Counsel because unlike the Kobina v Badu case above, the factual situation here does not include an admission of liability by the driver Akosah Kwadwo or a finding of this Court that he is liable for the accident due to his carelessness and/or negligence. With respect, the Plaintiff has erroneously relied on the conviction of the driver at the District Court to say the Defendant is liable. That has never been the law and the practice. The practice has always been that the driver ought to be a party to such a suit.  (44) As the Court of Appeal held in the case of ANSAH v. BUSANGA \[1976\] 2 GLR 488 through Anin, J.A at holding 2 “An admission by a driver of his negligence for an accident involving his vehicle was not admissible against his employer unless he had the express authority of the employer to make the admission or else, the admission was part of the res gestae”. See also the case of YAMUSAH v. MAHAMA AND OTHER \[1991\] 1 GLR 549. In this case there is no evidence that Akosah Kwadwo was the employee of the Defendant and/or its agent as the Plaintiff himself prevaricated on the issue. He initially said he had no proof that he was an employee of the Defendant but later said he was the Defendant’s agent. Also, there is no evidence that even if Akosah Kwadwo was the agent Defendant he had the express authority of the Defendant for the plea of guilt at the District Court.  (45) The law as I understand it is that in a matter such as one at bar, first and foremost there must be evidence to show that the driver was the employee of the owner and he was operating the vehicle in the course of his employment. Also, my read and review of all the cases cited by Counsel and my own research educates me that in cases such as the one at bar, there must be an establishment of liability against the driver before same can be attributed to the owner. Whilst considering this matter and reading the pages of the submissions, I was tempted to ask myself why the Plaintiff chose to discontinue against the driver of the vehicle but to proceed against the Defendant herein only? With all due deference to the Plaintiff and Counsel, without a finding of careless driving and negligence of the driver there cannot be a finding of vicarious liability of the owner based on the law.  (46) In this case I am of the opinion that the Defendant rebutted the presumption that Akosah Kwadwo was not its agent or employee based on the positive unimpeached evidence of the Defendant’s witness. It was therefore the Plaintiff’s onus to show that Akosah Kwadwo was indeed the agent of the Defendant. I am of the respectful view that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that there is a requisite relationship between Akosah Kwadwo, the driver of the Kia Rhino Truck and the Defendant. Therefore the Defendant cannot be said to be vicariously liable for the act of the driver who was not its employee. To my mind, mere ownership of the vehicle is not enough evidence to prove the Defendant’s liability in law of the alleged careless driving and negligence of the driver.  Conclusion & Disposition:  (47) From the above discourse therefore, I hold that the Defendant is not vicariously liable for the acts of Akosa Kwadwo the driver as the only evidence before the Court and which I accept is that he was not an employee or agent of the Defendant. Also, there is no evidence that the Defendant exercised control and possession of the KIA Rhino vehicle. As I have extensively discussed above, it was important for the Plaintiff to maintain the action against the driver, Akosah Kwadwo, Samuel Adjei who contracted the loan to purchase the vehicle, the Insurance Company and then the Defendant herein. The evidence before me amply shows that the Defendant cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts of the driver, Akosah Kwadwo just because its name appears on the DVLA documents as the owner. To my mind the Defendant successfully explained the circumstances of its ownership and I accept same as reasonable. Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s case is DISMISSED.  Finally, I consider it necessary to say that I have not come to this conclusion with any relish because of the peculiar facts of this case undoubtedly makes me have some sympathy for the Plaintiff. However whilst sympathizing with the Plaintiff for his plight because he has lost his source of income I can only re-echo the wise words of the late Chief Justice of this Republic, Justice Wiredu when he stated in OWUSU V. ASANTE (1992-93) 2GBR 462 @ 495, Wiredu that “Judicial sympathy, however plausible cannot be elevated into a principle of law.” Taking a cue, in my respectful opinion, no matter how strong a sympathy I may feel for the Plaintiff based on the circumstances of the case, that on its own cannot trump and override the fact that the law ought to be applied.  Based on the facts and the circumstances I shall exercise my discretion not to award costs against the Plaintiff.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"RULING  TORKORNOO (MRS), J.A.  The Plaintiff/Appellant/Applicant (hereinafter referred to as Applicant), commenced an action in the High Court on 8th January 2015 alleging in its statement of claim that in March 2013, the 1st Respondent had expressed interest in buying the Applicant’s interest in its two plots of land situate in Asokwa. The Applicant believed its interest to be subsisting until May 2060. However, during the negotiations, the 1st Respondent managed to produce a search report purporting to have come from the 3rd Respondent which indicated that the Applicant’s lease had already expired in 2011.  Then acting with shareholders of the Applicant, the 1st Respondent signed a Memorandum of Understanding prepared by the 1st Respondent to the effect that, as part of the amount agreed between one Mr. Nigel Egyir Yaw and Mr. C S Sethi towards the Applicant’s property, the 1st Respondent would pay GH¢200,000 to the 1st Respondent’s own lawyer and 1 million Ghana cedis the 2nd Respondent on behalf of the Applicant, for the renewal of the lease.  According to the Applicant’s Statement of Claim, the Managing Director of the Applicant, sought confirmation from the Applicant’s lawyers regarding the period of the lease and received confirmation that the representations from the 1st Respondent that it expired in 2011 was untrue. Acting on behalf of the Applicant and in disagreement with the MOU signed by the shareholders, the Managing Director wrote to the Respondents informing them of the misrepresentations of the 1st and 3rd Respondents and demanding that the money ostensibly paid by 1st Respondent to its lawyers and the 2nd Respondent on behalf of Applicant should be returned to the 1st Respondent.  It was the Plaintiff’s case that the MOU was not the act of the Applicant, and even though the Applicant had not entered into any signed contract with the 1st Respondent regarding the lease, the  1st Respondent forcibly entered the Applicant’s premises, started to develop the property and causing damage to some of its property. It sought the following reliefs:  A declaration that there is no binding contract between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant’s sale of plot Nos. 16 and 20 Block ‘A’ Asokwa Industrial Area, Kumasi.  Further or in the alternative a declaration that the Plaintiff was and is entitled to withdrawal of the transaction to sell the said plots of land to the 1st Defendant.  A declaration that the 2nd Defendant has no right to demand and/or collect money from the Plaintiff as it is the office of the Administrator of Stool Lands which has the right under the constitution to do so, and that any such act is null and void and of no effect.  An order for the return of the GH¢1,200,000.00 to the 1st Defendant.  An order for recovery of possession.  An injunction to restrain the 1st Defendant whether by itself, its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever from entering or remaining on or continuing in occupation of the said land.  An injunction to restrain the Defendants whether by themselves, their agents or otherwise howsoever from interfering with the quiet enjoyment of the Plaintiff’s said land.  Damages.  Interest on the amount of such damages that this Honourable Court will award against the Defendant.  Further or other reliefs.  The Respondent took steps to technically knock out this action on the grounds that under Section 189  and (4) of the Companies Act 1963, Act 179 the law expected a Company to obtain leave from the court before commencing an action to pursue its rights on a contract entered into when its directors were not present in Ghana at the time of contracting.  Section 189 (3) and 4 (a) of Act 179 provides:  “The rights of the Company concerned under or arising out of a contract made during the time that a director of the Company is not present in Ghana is not enforceable by action or other legal proceedings  4a.  The Company may apply to the court for relief against the disability imposed by subsection (3) and the court, on being satisfied that it is just and equitable to grant relief, may grant the relief generally or as respects a particular contract and on the conditions that the court may impose”  The second ground stood on by Respondent to the life of this action is that counsel for Applicant Mr. E. N. Poku of Poku Nyamaa and Associates was not properly authorized by the Company to represent its interest in this law suit, and should therefore not be allowed to represent the Applicant.  The high court agreed with Respondent on their arguments, and held that, even though the court had not been told how many directors the Company had, the writ was null and void on the ground that on an interpretation of Section 189 (3) and 4 (a) of Act 179, the Applicant should have come to court and demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that they have a just cause to seek redress against the 1st Defendant, and not go to court as of right.  The court also held that after examining a Power of Attorney held by Applicant counsel, he was satisfied that the power of attorney only authorized Applicant counsel to represent the managing director of the Applicant Company in relation to the sale of the Company and therefore it ‘never authorized learned counsel to represent the (Applicant) in this suit.’ He therefore restrained Applicant counsel from representing the Applicant and struck out the writ, without allowing a consideration of the merits of the Applicant’s complaints. Appellant appealed against this judgment on the following grounds:  Grounds of appeal  The learned trial judge did not properly construe section 189 of the Companies Act 1963, Act 179 in the context of the whole statute that is Act 179.  The learned trial judge did not exercise his discretion judiciously when he refused Plaintiff’s application to put a certain Nigel Egyri Yaw in the witness box for cross-examination having regard to the compelling evidence that Osei Kwame Addai is the managing Director of the Plaintiff Company and not the said Nigel Egyri Yaw.  That the learned trial judge did not exercise his discretion judiciously when he restrained the Plaintiff’s lawyer from acting for the Plaintiff Company when no evidence was taken to determine his authority.  The learned trial judge erred by declaring that the Power of Attorney executed by the Managing Director of the Plaintiff Company, and notarised in the United States of America was backdated without taking evidence on that.  The trial judge decision granting the 1st Defendant application for setting aside Plaintiff’s Writ, and restraining Lawyer E. N. Poku from acting for the Plaintiff is against the weight of evidence.  Further grounds of appeal shall be filed upon receipt of a copy of the Record of Proceedings Prior to setting aside the Applicant’s writ and declaring the writ as null and void on 27th February 2015, the high court had, according to the Applicant, granted an application for injunction on 12th January 2015 to restrain the Respondents from interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and entering and/or remaining on the land in dispute. According to Respondent counsel, Applicant counsel repeated this application for injunction on 22nd January 2015. Following the declaration of the action as void, the court continued to sit on this application and dismissed it on 15th July 2015.  Learned counsel for Applicant then repeated the application for injunction pending the determination of the appeal in the court of appeal. The application was heard by a single Judge of the Court of Appeal. The application for injunction was favorably considered and granted on conditions that the Applicant retrieve the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis paid by the 1st Respondent as part consideration for the lease in dispute while the 1st Respondent is restrained from using the premises of the Applicant pending determination of the appeal. The injunction was to lapse after 10 days if this condition of retrieving the money was not complied with.  As ordered by the court in the injunction order by the single Judge of the Court of Appeal, the 1st Respondent moved from the premises. The Applicant however did not satisfy the condition of retrieving the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis as ordered by the court.  According to its depositions per their counsel in the affidavit supporting this application, the Applicant could not retrieve the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis because firstly, there is no evidence that the 1st Respondent even paid this 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis described as part of the consideration for the disputed transaction. Secondly, even if it was paid, that payment was supposed to have gone to the 2nd Respondent and 1st Respondent’s own lawyer, putting it out of the control of the Applicant.  The Applicant appealed the order regarding the conditions set for the injunction to the Supreme Court and later discontinued this appeal. He then applied to the full panel of the Court of Appeal pursuant to Section 12 of the Courts Act 1993 Act 493, to vary and or review the conditions of the injunction granted by the single judge. Section 12 of Act 493 provides  Section 12 – Powers of Single Justice of the Court of Appeal  A singe Justice of the Court of Appeal may exercise a power vested in the court of appeal that does not involve the decision o f a cause or matter before the court of appeal, except that –  b. In civil matters any order, direction or decision made or given in exercise of the powers conferred by this section may be varied, discharged or reversed by the Court of Appeal as duly constituted. ….  This court was unable to consider the invitation to vary or review the conditional injunction for the technical reason that the 10 day life span given the injunction order pending the retrieval of the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis had lapsed by the time the application for review was brought to the full panel of the court of appeal.  The Applicant has once again applied for this injunction. One of the Applicant’s arguments is that the condition for payment of the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis on behalf of the Applicant would result in injustice because it was a condition that the Applicant could not fulfil. In paragraphs 25 and 26 of the affidavit, counsel says:  25\. That there is also no proof of payment of the purported sum for which reason for Plaintiff to retrieve a said sum which was never paid would result in grave injustice visited on a Party who has a legal right to be protected.  26\. That granted arguendo that any monies were paid by the 1st Defendant, from the said MOU, they were not  paid to the Plaintiff but to the 2nd Defendant herein and the present lawyers of 1st Defendant on record for which reason it would not be just and convenient for Plaintiff to retrieve monies which are already with the  Defendants and/or with the 1st Defendant’s lawyer Mariam Agyeman Gyasi Jawhary…’  He also urged in paragraph 30 of the affidavit that the Applicant had already tried to retrieve this 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis and it was unable to fulfill the condition of retrieving the money because the 1st Respondent failed to assist the Applicant to retrieve the said monies which the 1st Respondent had purportedly paid its own lawyers and the Amakomhene and this is why the order for injunction lapsed.  The second argument of the Applicant is that although the 1st Respondent moved out of the disputed  land after the order for injunction by the single judge on 19th November 2015, the 1st Respondent had since the lapsing of the order, returned to the premises and was rapidly changing the nature of the land and destroying part of the property, making changes to it which would be irreversible, and causing irreparable damage to the Applicant’s property and equipment.  A third argument was that a search report dated 25th April 2016 from the 3rd Respondent had now thrown up conflicting information that gravely affected the dynamics of the transaction in the dispute brought to the court for resolution. In this report, (exhibit L) the 3rd Respondent stated that the lease expired in 2011 and the land was being repossessed by the 2nd Respondent. This ‘re-possession’ position was different from the alleged ‘renewal’ earlier complained of by the Applicant in its Statement of Claim as forming the basis of the alleged Memorandum of Understanding reached between the 1st Respondent and the shareholders of the Applicant which the Applicant had brought to court for the reliefs claimed.  But apart from this conflicting information, the Applicant also had the indenture under which the Applicant acquired the lease in issue. This was an assignment of the remainder of a 99 year lease from the original lessee of the land, Mr. Francis Nyama Oppon. According to Applicant, what was significant about this indenture is that the 2nd Respondent, who according to 3rd Respondent was ready to re-possess the ‘expired’ lease, had consented to the assignment of the 99 years lease to the  Applicant, showing that the 3rd Respondent had at all times known that the lease was to expire in 2060 and not 2011.  In effect, the basis for the transaction which the Applicant had already brought to court for cancellation on grounds of contract failure through misrepresentation, and invalidity of corporate authority, was also affected negatively by wrong transactions being conducted around the land by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, and on the blind side of the Applicant. He argued that these new documentation presented a change in the dynamics of the present case, necessitating the court to consider the justice and convenience of the case and repeat its order for injunction without the condition attached.  The Respondent has strenuously opposed this Applicant. Once again, its response hinge on procedural and technical reasons for not listening to the application. First they argue that the writ was struck out and therefore there is no action pending in the courts to allow this court to consider the application for injunction. Second, they point to the string of applications that the Applicant has brought to court in the quest for an injunction and prays the court to find this application an abuse of process.  Third, they point to the decision in the case of Republic v High Court, Accra (Commercial Division);  Ex Parte Hesse, (Investcom Consortium Holdings SA & Scancom Ltd Interested Parties) 2007-2008 SC GLR 1230. In holding 4, the Supreme Court had said that  “notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal against an order of refusal of an application, or the fact that an appellate court was seised with the appeal, and consequently all applications related thereto must be presented to the appellate court, not the court of first instance; where a losing party has come by new or fresh material in circumstances that justify a repeat application, it – the repeat application – must be laid before the trial court, not the appellate court, since it would be a fresh application, wholly independent of the first”  It was their submission that if this application for injunction is a repeat application premised on the discoveries in the 3rd Respondent’s letter of 25th April 2016 about the 2nd Respondent repossessing the land in issue, rather than the 2nd and 3rd Respondent renewing the lease; as well as the sighting of 3rd Respondent’s consent to the original lessor assigning his interest in a 99 year lease to the Applicant; then per the above holding, the proper forum for this fresh application is the high court.  Their fourth argument is that since the record of appeal has not as yet been transmitted to the Court of Appeal by the issue of Form 6, the court of appeal is not seised with jurisdiction to hear an application such as an application for injunction. They referred to a reading of rules 14 (2) and 21 of the Court of Appeal Rules CI 19 together. Rule 21 of CI 19 directs that  21\. Control of proceedings during pendency of appeal  After the record of appeal has been transmitted from the court below to the court, the court shall be seized of the whole of the proceedings as between the parties and every application shall be made to the court and not to the court below, but an application may be filed in the court below for transmission to the court.  Their submission is that until the transmission of the record of appeal, the only applications the court of appeal can determine as of right are applications for extension of time within which to appeal after the court below has refused the application per rule 9, applications for stay of execution per rule 27 after the court below has refused that application, and application for stay of proceedings pending the determination of an interlocutory appeal per rule 27A of CI 19. Thus the Applicant was not entitled to the injunction from the court of appeal, because the court was not yet seised with control of all proceedings.  Regarding the fact that the injunction was first granted on conditions only for it to lapse, they submitted that the Applicant cannot purport to repeat in the Court of the Appeal, the application dismissed by the High court. They referred to the case of Republic v High court Kumasi: Ex Parte Sefa (Bank of Ghana Interested Party) (No 2); Republic v High Court, Kumasi: Ex Parte Gyamfi (Bank of Ghana Interested Party) (No 2) (Consolidated) 2013-2014) 1 SCGLR 512.  As required of a court, I have carefully reviewed the submissions of counsels on law and facts and the documents supporting the present application. I have also carefully read the provisions of CI 19 pertaining to applications.  Regarding the nullity of the writ, I believe counsel for Respondent has misjudged the effect of a judgment on appeal. And regarding the inappropriateness of this application, I see that counsel for Respondent has mis-appreciated the import of the provisions of CI 19 and the authorities that he is citing.  First, the arguments concerning the nullity of the writ. If the Respondent counsel’s position that there is no writ existing in this suit because of the high court’s pronouncement that the writ in this context was void is upheld, it will lead to the absurd result that no court, either the high court, the court of appeal or the supreme court in its supervisory jurisdiction over the high court can address any issues pertaining to this case because of that judgment.  However, it is trite learning that the potency of a judgment stands only in so far as it is not challenged on appeal and its execution stayed by an order of the court that gave the judgment or an appellate court. In the present case, the declaration of this writ as null and void has been challenged on appeal, and the judgment to the extent of restraining Applicant’s Counsel from representing it, stayed to enable the decision to be examined on appeal. In the order for stay of execution, this court also allowed Applicant counsel to prosecute the appeal, pending the determination of the propriety or otherwise of the orders in the judgment. Thus, the action commenced in the high court continues to be extremely active until all litigation raised pursuant thereto have been settled either to the satisfaction of the disputants, or by the last orders of the Supreme Court. This is the import of the machinery of justice.  In the Ex parte Hesse case cited by Respondent counsel, the Supreme Court considered whether the filing of a notice of withdrawal of appeal ended the litigation commenced by the filing of a notice of appeal. The Court per Wood CJ clarified that to the extent that the court’s rules of procedure allowed for further steps to be taken after the withdrawal of appeal, the notice of withdrawal cannot be said to have ended the appeal. The court drew attention to the principle that in the construction of statutes, the proper approach is to adopt a subjective-purpose rule, which allows a court to accept the literalist, ordinary, plain, or grammatical meaning of the words of a statute only if it clearly advances the legislative purpose or intent and does not lead to any outrageous consequences. If the literal interpretation of a statute will lead to outrageous consequences, then a court is enjoined to examine the subjective purpose of the statute.  What is the import of the complex arrangements made by the 1992 Constitution, the Courts Act and the various Rules of Procedure for Appeals and post judgment applications? They are to make sure that any action brought to court is kept alive for evaluation of the rightness of any decision unless all processes for establishing the final answer have been exhausted. It is within this context that I dismiss the underlined submission of Respondent counsel that ‘There is no writ pending and therefore Applicant’s application is incompetent’  The next point for consideration is whether this application is properly before this court. Clearly, the only place to look for a determination of whether the Court of Appeal can determine an application for injunction such as is before us is within its enabling statutes.  CI 19 provides for various types of applications to be made to the Court of Appeal and orders to be made by the court in specific contexts. They include applications for extension of time within which to appeal under rule 9, orders for additional security for costs under rule 13, orders dismissing the appeal for non-compliance with various rules on the payment of deposits and securities, for withdrawal of appeals under rule 17, with or without costs, and all manner of orders and applications that the legislature deemed fit to make specific provision for. I have enumerated the above to show that the submission by counsel for Respondent on pages 2 and 3 of his submissions filed on 9th June 2016 that the only applications that the court of appeal can deal with before the transmission of the record of appeal are repeat applications for extension of time and stay of execution, and applications for stay of proceedings in the court below pending the determination of an interlocutory appeal, is untenable.  Such an evaluation of the applications that the court of appeal can deal with before the transmission of proceedings is not at all supported by the law.  In addition to various specific applications which may be addressed by the court before the record is transmitted, CI 19 also gives general powers to the court for various orders. This can be found under Rule 31  31\. General powers of the Court  The Court shall generally have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted and prosecuted in the court as a court of first instance, and may  Make an order necessary for determining the real question in controversy;  Amend a defect or error in the record of appeal;  Direct a notice of appeal to be served on all or any of the parties to the action or any other proceedings or on a person not a party, and may adjourn the hearing of an appeal on the terms that are just, and also make an order as if the person served with the notice had originally been a party to the appeal;  Direct the court below to enquire into and certify its finding on a question which the court considers fit to determine before final judgment’  Make an interim order or grant an injunction which the court below is authorized to make or grant; and  Direct any necessary enquiries or accounts to be made or taken  Having established that the scope of applications that may be brought to the court of appeal before transmission of the records is so much broader than what learned counsel for Respondent has urged on this court, I must next look at how applications are to be presented to the Court of Appeal.  This is catered for in rule 28 thus:  28\. Court to which application should be made  Subject to these Rules and to any other enactment, where under an enactment an application may be made to the court below or to the court, it shall be made in the first instance to the court below, but if the court below refuses to grant the application, the Applicant is entitled to have the application determined by the court.  It is Rule 28 which establishes that unless provided for otherwise, all applications authorized by enactments should first go to the court below and may be repeated in the Court of Appeal if the court below does not grant same. Rule 28 is subject to Rule 21 which gives the Court of Appeal sole jurisdiction over proceedings and applications after the record has been transmitted from the court below.  Reading rules 28 and 21 together, the appreciation is that unless differently provided for, (and there are several of these different orders – such as orders under rules 13, 17, and 18) all applications allowed in proceedings on appeal should first be made in the high court and may be repeated in the Court of Appeal if the high court refuses to grant same. However after transmission of the record of appeal to the court of appeal, the Court Appeal becomes seised with sole control of the proceedings.  It is therefore unfortunate that Respondent counsel’s submission missed this proper interpretation of the provisions made by CI 19 for the hearing of applications by the Court of Appeal.  I do not see that the teaching of the learned author and jurist, Sir Justice Dennis Dominic Adjei on page 118 of his book Land Law, Practice and Conveyancing in Ghana, Adwinsa Publications (GH) Ltd 2015 as quoted by counsel for Respondent, supports the position espoused by him on page 3 of his submissions that ‘an application for injunction can only be entertained by the court of appeal when the court is properly seised with the appeal, that is, the record has been transmitted to the court of appeal’.  Neither do I see how the facts and ratio in Republic v High court Kumasi: Ex Parte Sefa (Bank of  Ghana Interested Party) (No 2); Republic v High Court, Kumasi: Ex Parte Gyamfi (Bank of Ghana Interested Party) (No 2) (Consolidated) 2013-2014) 1 SCGLR 512 can assist with the resolution of the present case. That decision concerned an application to the high court to set aside a default judgment granted by the high court when the decision of the high court earlier refusing that same application had been appealed in the Court of Appeal, affirmed, and the Court of Appeal decision appealed in the Supreme Court, and the appeal to the Supreme Court was awaiting decision. The facts of that case and the current case are poles apart and no principle from that case can be related to the current case.  With this foundation, I will now examine whether or not the application in dispute is properly before us. Being an application for injunction, Rule 31 of CI 19 gives this court general power to deal with the application, rule 28 allows this court to deal with a repeat application from the high court, and section 12(b) of the Courts Act allows the court to vary, discharge or reverse an order for injunction made by a single Judge of the court of appeal.  In the instant case, the application was first submitted to the high court, and repeated in the court of appeal. At the court of appeal, it was dealt with by a single judge and granted, subject to conditions.  It is because the order of the single judge lapsed after 10 days owing to the non-fulfillment of the conditions attached to it that this court was disabled from examining on merit whether it is just and convenient for the court to vary, discharge, reverse or affirm the original grant by the single Judge.  Is this matter res judicata just because the original application for injunction was granted by the single judge and lapsed after 10 days? Once again, I would say no. Rule 31 (e) of CI 19 allows this court general power to ‘make an interim order or grant an injunction which the court below is authorized to make or grant’. This would include looking afresh at an application for injunction which had earlier been granted on terms.  As was stated regarding applications for injunctions which are repeated in the same court in Vanderpuye v Nartey 1977 GLR 428 ‘The courts must be left to determine at their discretion when a party is using their processes to pursue his frivolous or vexatious ends’. The critical requirement of a court in an application for injunction is to determine whether it is just and convenient to grant same.  Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act allows the full court to look again at an order earlier made by a single judge. Rule 28 of CI 19 allows a party to repeat an application which was earlier presented to the court below for consideration of the full court of appeal.  I am quite satisfied that the combined effects of Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act, rule 28 and 31 (e) of CI 19 give this court sufficient authority to admit the application as being in accordance with due process and consider it on its merit, given the fact that the original injunction order was made by a single judge of the court and lapsed after 10 days. I am also satisfied that the repetition of this application will not constitute an abuse of process because inter alia, this application addresses the reasons why the conditions attached to the first order could not be obeyed.  I will now consider the application on its merits. The critical issue for this court to consider is whether on the strength of the pleadings, affidavits, exhibits and submissions brought to this court, it is just and convenient to grant this application without the conditions that the single Judge earlier attached to the order, because it is these conditions that caused the first order to lapse.  The fact that the Applicant has thrown in ‘new material’ that its counsel says has been discovered since April 2016 does not detract from the fact that but for the conditions which the Applicant says were impracticable to fulfill, the earlier order would not have lapsed and this application could not be before us.  Injunctions are equitable reliefs that serve the purpose of ensuring that the subject matter of a dispute is not endangered during the pendency of the dispute resolution.  The general principle is that a court may exercise discretion to grant an application for injunction if the Applicant presents a case that is prima facie sustainable, not frivolous or vexatious and there is a real likelihood of irreparable damage being done to his interest in the subject matter of dispute if it is not protected from the acts complained of. There is a wealth of case law on the grounds for granting an order of injunction, several of which were cited by counsel for Applicants in his submission. My humble view is that it would be an unnecessary burden on this ruling to regurgitate them, especially when I have summarized the principles they lay down in the paragraph above.  In granting the first order of injunction, this court per the single Judge, in order to keep the balance between the parties, directed the Applicant to retrieve the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis ostensibly paid by the Respondent on behalf of the Applicant, while the Respondent moved out of the land in dispute.  A close look at the pleadings exhibited show that from the commencement of this action, Applicant complained that it had not sanctioned the payment of that money by 1st Respondent to its own lawyer, and the Amakomhene, and had actually requested the return of the money to 1st Respondent because it did not agree to the transaction in issue. This, it claims, was as far back as September 2014. The Applicant had also sought as part of its reliefs, an order of this court ‘for the return of the GH¢1,200,000 to the 1st Defendant’  Under such circumstances, it is certainly to be appreciated that the directive to ensure the return of the money it is seeking the court’s help to retrieve would have been herculean for it to achieve within the 10 day period. It is within this context that I find this repeat application to the court not a frivolous one, after the court had earlier granted the application on condition.  But apart from that, I also see that it is just and convenient to hold a balance between the parties regarding retaining the integrity of title and physical condition of this land and property pending the resolution of the appeal, and this obviously was the leaning of the single judge when she earlier granted the injunction.  The learned trial judge dismissed this suit without hearing it on the merits of the complaints per his evaluation of the import of Section 189 (3) of Act 179. However Article 125 (1) of the Constitution directs that ‘Justice emanates from the people of Ghana’ and it is only ‘administered in the name of the Republic by the Judiciary’. Thus when a citizen’s case is knocked out on technical grounds without being heard, and he appeals, I believe a prima facie case is made out to hold the balance evenly between the parties while that preliminary issue concerning whether or not the case can be determined on its merits is examined.  If the appellate courts considering this decision affirm it, the parties would have had their day in court as provided for by the Constitution. Thus this court must lean on the side of ensuring that the subject matter of the dispute is not unduly compromised before the dust settles.  Within the action itself, I see that there are complex legal issues that require careful consideration of the justice of the cause of both parties if the writ survives the appeal. These complexities cover the validity of the transaction in issue, flowing from the Applicant’s complaints about the lawfulness of authorizations of the transaction in dispute under Company law and validity of the action, flowing from the trial court’s observations about the lawfulness of the authorization to commence this action under legal procedure and Company law; whether there was misrepresentation about the subject matter of the transaction and the considerations of the transaction, flowing from the complaints of the Applicant. These are all complex issues in the law of contract, in Company law in procedure and the law of real property.  With the investments allegedly made by the 1st Respondent, and the complaint about payment of  consideration for the lease to the 2nd Respondent and not administrator of stool lands as alleged by Applicant, I am satisfied that irreversible harm may be done to the interest of either party if this court does not hold the interests of the parties in balance prior to a judicial enquiry into the issues of fact and law raised by the case, in the event that the appeal succeeds.  Regarding on whose side irreversible harm will lie if the injunction is not granted prior to determination of the appeal, I do not find it difficult to determine that both parties stand in grave danger of severe losses if they are not kept away from causing irreparable change to the nature of the subject matter and the matter is decided in favor of either party at the end of the suit.  It has already been demonstrated that when the first order was given by this court that the Respondent move from the site in dispute, it was able to obey the court’s order in a speedy fashion. Thus an order to the Respondent to restrain it from dealing with, disposing of, alienating and/or interfering, entering and/or remaining in occupation of the land in dispute pending the determination of the appeal should not be a matter of grave difficulty. If it has easily obeyed it the first time, it can continue with this order.  We now go further and restrain not only the 1st Respondent, but the Applicant and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents from in any way disposing of, or consenting to the alienation of any interests in Plots nos. 16 and 20 Block A, Asokwa Industrial Area, Kumasi, pending the final determination of the appeal against the decision of the High Court dated 27th February 2015.  The application is granted in the above terms. No order as to costs.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E. N.

"JUDGMENT  HONYENUGA, JA  This appeal is against the Ruling of the High Court (Commercial Division), Accra dated the 24th day of January, 2017. In the said ruling, the High Court dismissed the 1st and 2nd defendants/appellants application to attach the properties of the plaintiff/respondents and its Directors for non-payment of the Judgment debt dated the 31st day of July 2015. In this appeal, the 1st and 2nd defendants/appellants would be simply referred to as the appellants and the plaintiff/respondent and the Directors as the respondents.  The facts of this appeal may be stated as that the respondent initiated an action against the appellants and others at the High Court, Commercial Division, Accra claiming inter alia an injunction to restrain them from interfering with the respondent’s quiet possession of the concession and quarry to mine limestone/dolomitic limestone, and refund of GH¢2.3million. The appellants among others counterclaimed, claiming recovery of GH¢1,829,650.00 being outstanding balance on the contract executed by the appellant at the instance of the respondent. The 3rd defendant thereon also counterclaim which left the 4th defendant to only file a Statement of Defence. Upon the close of pleadings, an application for directions was taken and the case was heard to its finality. The learned trial judge in his judgment entered judgment for the appellants and the 3rd and 4th defendants therein, upon their counterclaim for general damages for breach of contract among other claims together with various costs. On the 22nd day of June 2016, the appellants filed a motion on notice for leave to attach the properties of the Directors of the respondent on the grounds that the respondent company failed to pay the judgment debts, that a garnishee order issued against the respondent yielded no more than GH¢674,151.91 and that the appellants had not sighted any valuable movable and immovable properties to be attached to defray the outstanding judgment debt.  The motion was vehemently opposed. Upon hearing both counsel for the parties, the learned trial judge dismissed the motion and another motion to pierce the veil of the respondent based on the principles of company law, that the Directors cannot be held liable and that the corporate veil could not be pierced in aid of execution in the circumstances of the case. It is against this ruling that the appellants have appealed to this court, praying that the ruling be reversed based on the following grounds:  “(i) The learned trial judge erred in the exercise of discretion in refusing the application for leave to attach the properties of Directors and Officers of the plaintiff/respondent company brought under Order 43 Rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I. 47 as amended filed on 11/7/2016.  (ii) The learned trial judge erred in her ruling that the judgment could not be effected against the Directors and Officers of the plaintiff/respondent company because they were not parties to the suit.  (ii) The learned trial judge erred in her failure to give separate rulings in respect of the application filed by the appellants herein and another application filed by the 3rd defendant seeking to pierce the corporate veil in aid of execution filed on 4/7/2016.  (iv) The learned trial judge failed to adequately consider the case of the 1st and 2nd defendants/appellants.  Further grounds of appeal to be filed upon receipt of a copy of the record of proceedings”.  It is noted that further grounds were not filed and they are considered abandoned.  I would consider the ground of appeal as filed and argued by the learned counsel for the appellants. Counsel first argued ground (i) of the notice of appeal and straight away attacked the learned trial judge’s decision for having agreed with a submission that the appellants’ application was incompetent in failing to show that the Order 43 Rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I. 47 relied upon included rules 5(1)(a) and (b) which they conveniently left out in making the application before he followed it with the sub sections (aa), (bb) and (cc) and that alone was sufficient to dismiss the application. Counsel submitted that in making reference to the Rules of Court the entire Rules under the Order are looked at and considered as a whole and not in isolation and therefore the learned trial judge erred in her holding as such. Learned counsel further referred to Order 43 Rule 5, 5(1) rule 9(2) of C.I. 47 and contended that the appellants opted for Rule 5(1)(bb) for leave to attach the properties of the directors and other officers of the respondent company. Counsel referred to Klimatechnik Engineering Ltd. v Skanska Jensen International \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 913 at 917 Holding 2 and stated therefore that the trial court failed to consider the entire Rule 5 of Order 43 in determining the application and urge this court to allow the appeal. Learned counsel for the appellants stated that there is no doubt that Morten Gode and Thornvaldsen Reider are directors of the respondent. Pages 38 to 43 of the record of appeal indicated the financial statement of the respondent company as Exhibit ‘A’ with the Directors and Ghacem Limited as 100% shareholders. Counsel also referred to Exhibit DM1 on pages 81 to 83 of the record of appeal which showed that Dominik Michel was appointed as Director in place of Reider Thorvaldsen and contended that the appellants cannot be faulted for invoking the jurisdiction of the court to attach their properties to satisfy the judgment debt dated 31/7/2015.  Learned counsel referred to the definition of sequestration and contended that by the rules, the appellants were clothed with jurisdiction to apply with leave for a writ of sequestration against the Directors. He submitted that the trial judge erred in the exercise of her unfettered discretion in dismissing the appellants’ application. Counsel then referred to Article 296(a) and (b) of the 1992 Constitution and submitted that the trial judge contravened the Article 296 of the Constitution by not exercising her discretion by ignoring Order 43 rule 5 as a whole in determining the application. Counsel referred to Kojach Ltd. v Multichoice Ghana Limited \[2013-2014\] 2 SCGLR 1994 (it should read 1494) Holding 2 in support of the grounds of a court exercising its discretion. Counsel further referred to the Kojach Ltd case and invites this court to interfere with the exercise of the trial court’s discretion.  Further, learned counsel submitted that the Directors were all served with copies of the judgment or order of the court. Counsel submitted that the directors and Ghacem Ltd. have active and constructive notices of the judgment of the court and therefore the trial judge erred in dismissing the application. Counsel further submitted that the directors and Ghacem Ltd. have waived any irregularity by not raising any objection on grounds of non-service and this can be cured under Order 81 of C.I. 47 on Enforcement of Judgment for payment of money. Counsel contended that the judgment of the court which the appellant sought to enforce is for the payment of money by writ of sequestration under Rule 1(1) and there is no gainsaying that the appellants chose to enforce the judgment by relying on Rule 5 of Order 43. Counsel finally submitted that the dismissal of the appellants’ application was most unfortunate and the Honourable trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion.  Before I address the arguments as stated, I shall quote in extenso the relevant provisions of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (C.I. 47) namely, Order 43 rules 1(1), 5(1)(aa), 5(1)(bb), 5(1)(cc) and 12(1) respectively as follows:-  “Order 43 rule (1). Subject to these Rules, a judgment or order for the payment of money, not being a judgment or order for the payment into court, may be enforced by one or more of the following means:  (a) Writ of fieri facias;  (b) Garnishee proceedings;  (c) A charging order  (d) The appointment of a receiver;  (e) In a case in which rule 5 applies, an order of committal or a writ of sequestration. 5(1) where  (a) A person required by a judgment or order to do an act within a time specified in the judgment or order refuses or neglects to do it within that time or within that time as extended or reduced under  Order 80 rule 4; or  (b) A person disobeys a judgment or order requiring the person to abstain from doing an act, the judgment or order may subject to these Rules be enforced by one or more of the following means:  (aa) a writ of sequestration against the property of that person with leave of the court;  (bb) a writ of sequestration against the property of any director or other officer of the body where that person is a body corporate, with leave of the court; or  (cc) an order of committal against that person or, where that person is a body corporate against any director or other officer.  12(1) Rule 1(1) of this Order with the omission of paragraph (e) and Orders 27, 44 to 47 and 49 shall apply to a judgment or order for the payment of money”.  In my considered opinion, the main issue in this appeal is whether the judgment could be enforced against the Directors who were not parties to the action? At this stage, I wish to address the appellants’ initial complain that the learned trial judge was wrong in agreeing to the submission that the appellants left out the order under which their application was brought but upon moving the application they attempted to rely on Order 43 Rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I. 47. For avoidance of doubt, I would reproduce the motion filed by the appellants on 22/6/16 as follows:-  “Motion on Notice for leave to Attach Properties of Directors  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that this Honourable Court will be moved by Lawyer for and on behalf of the  1st and 2nd defendants/judgment creditors, the applicants herein praying for leave of the court to issue a writ of fi-fa commanding the sheriff of the court to cause to be made out a writ of attachment on the properties of the Directors i.e. Morten Gade and Shareholders i.e. Ghana Cement Company Ltd. (Ghacem) or other officers of the plaintiff/judgment-debtor company in respect of the judgment debt which the plaintiff company has willfully refused or neglected to pay in terms of the annexed affidavit. AND FOR any further order(s) as to this court may deem fit”.  The relevant paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the affidavit in support of the motion is reproduced as follows:-  “4. That the plaintiffs have willfully refused or neglected to pay to the applicants the judgment debt, interest and cost.  5\. That we have not sighted any valuable movable and immovable properties to be attached to defray the outstanding judgment debt.  6\. That by the plaintiffs’ own showing the director/shareholders of her are Morten Gade, its Managing Director, Thorvaldsen Rider whiles Ghana Cement Co. Ltd. i.e. Ghacem limited is the 100%, shareholders. Please see Exhibit ‘A’.  7\. That the Directors/shareholders have sufficient funds and or properties (both movable and immovable) to pay the judgment debt, interest and cost but have willfully refused to pay.  8\. That the Directors/shareholders of the plaintiff company are aware of the unsatisfied judgment debt but continue to file frivolous applications to delay the payment and thereby frustrate the applicants in realizing the full compliments of the judgment of the court.  9\. In the circumstances I swear to this affidavit in support of the application for the leave of the court for an attachment against the Directors, Shareholders and other officers of the plaintiff company for the payment of the judgment debt, interest and cost referred to in paragraph 2 supra”.  It is thus obvious that the motion was not brought under any specified rule. It is incumbent upon counsel who appear before the courts to state and identify the powers of the court under which the jurisdiction of the court is invoked. This is the yardstick which the court would use to determine its jurisdiction. The Supreme court per Dr. Date-Bah JSC espouced this principle of caution in Ashanti  Goldfields Co. Ltd. v West Chester Resources Ltd. (Consolidated) \[2013-2014\] 1 SCGLR 398 at page 401 as follows:-  “This court does not have indeterminate and limit less power to straddle the judicial system dispensing orders right, left and centre from its ample powers. Its powers are derived from the Constitution, Statute and practice (including settled rules as to inherent power). Counsel therefore, owes an obligation to identify which of this: Court’s powers he is relying on”.  Counsel for the appellants at the High Court failed to indicate the Order they relied on the motion paper. The learned trial judge was right in her observation at page 209 to 210 of the record of appeal as follows:-  “The question I then ask myself is by what means or process are the applicants attempting to achieve their aim? In respect of the 1st and 2nd applicants, they have attempted to invoke the jurisdiction of the court by relying on Order 43 Rule 5(1) (bb) of C.I. 47 as seen earlier on thus ruling. They have been taken on by the counsel for the Directors of GHACEM for bringing up an incompetent application in failing to show that the Order relied upon included 5(1)(a) & (b) conveniently left out in making this application before it is followed by the sub sections (aa), (bb) and (cc). In as much as I agree with the learned counsel that this alone is sufficient to dismiss the application, I propose to deal with the entirety of the submissions made so at this stage I do proceed”.  The learned trial judge was therefore right in proceeding to further hear and consider the application based on Order 43 Rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I. 47 which counsel for the appellants invoked in moving the application. What is sequestration? The learned author, S. Kwami Tetteh in his book “CIVIL PROCEDURE: A PRACTICAL APPROACH” at page 1007 stated that:-  “Sequestration is a dramatic process for the enforcement of a judgment or order. It freezes the assets of a contemnor for as long as the disobedience of a decision persists. It is available in all cases including matrimonial causes and proceedings against the state. It applies to assets of individuals, corporate bodies or their directors or officers who neglect to comply with a judgment or order directing payment of money into court (Order 43 r.1(2)(b), C.I. 47) or default of a judgment or order restraining an act or directing the performance of an act within a specified time, such as an order that the party or corporate body yield possession of immovable property within a specified time or to deliver possession of movable property within a specified time. It does not however lie for the enforcement of a judgment or order for payment of money. Sequestration is a process in the nature of contempt proceeding. (Emphasis mine)”  As rightly stated by learned counsel for the respondents, order 43 rule 1(e) of C.I. 47 (supra) allows for committal or a writ of sequestration in enforcement of judgment or orders for payment of money where Order 43 rule 5 applies. Order 43 rule 5(1)(bb) under which the appellants’ application was considered provides that where a person required by a judgment or order to do an act within a specified time or neglects to comply, the judgment or order may be enforced by a writ of sequestration against the property of any director or other officer of the body corporate, with leave of the court. However, the judgment or order may also be enforced under Order 43 rule 5(1)(cc) by an order of Committal against that person or where that person is a body corporate, against any director or other officer. There is however, a contradiction, while order 43 rule 1(e) allows the payment of money not being a judgment or order for payment of money into court by committal or a writ of sequestration, order 43 rule 12(1) of C.I. 47 with the omission of Order 43 rule 1(1)(e) allows for enforcement of a judgment or order for the payment of money. In other words, a judgment or order for the payment of money by order 43 rule 12(1) cannot be enforced by a committal or a writ of sequestration. The provisions under Order 43 rule 5(1) are general and relate to the performance or abstention of acts which are not specified in the statute while those in Order 43 rule 12(1) relate specifically to the enforcement of judgment and an order for the recovery of money. The facts in the instant appeal are on all fours with the Supreme Court judgment in Republic v High Court (Fast Track Division) Accra; Ex parte PPE Ltd. & Paul Junc (Unique Trust Financial Services Ltd. Interested Party) \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 188. The facts in the PPE Limited case were that Unique Trust Financial Services Ltd., the interested party in the proceedings before the court had obtained judgment in the Fast Track High Court, Accra for the sum of (old cedis) ¢1,328,797.91 against PPE Ltd. (hereinafter called the first applicant). After several failed efforts to execute the judgment, the interested party filed an application before the Fast Track High Court, Accra for an order to require the first applicant company to pay the judgment debt within six weeks from the date of the application. The learned High Court Judge (Gyaesayor, J) duly ordered that the debt be paid within the period of six weeks.  Subsequently, when the 1st applicant company failed to comply with the order of the High Court, the interested party, Unique Trust Financial Services Ltd. filed a motion seeking to commit to prison for contempt Mr. Paul Junc, the 2nd applicant, in his capacity as a director of the 1st applicant company for the 1st applicant’s failure to comply with the court order to pay the judgment debt within the said six weeks period.  At the hearing of the motion, counsel for the 1st applicant company and the 2nd applicant, Mr. Paul Junc raised a preliminary objection to it, but the learned High Court Judge overruled it.  Consequently, the 1st and 2nd applicants therefore brought an application before the Supreme Court to invoke its Supervisory jurisdiction to quash the ruling of the learned High Court Judge and to prohibit him from proceeding with the contempt proceedings pending before him. The Supreme Court “held unanimously granting the application for an order of certiorari and of prohibition from hearing the committal proceedings for contempt of court that the provisions in Order 43, r. 5(1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47) are general and relate to the performance and abstention from acts which are not specified in the rule. However, the provision in Order 43 rule 12(1) of C.I. 47 relates specifically to the enforcement of judgment or order for the payment of money. On the application of the rule of interpretation, i.e. the generalibus specialia denegant (special provisions override general ones), the specific or special provision in Order 43 rule 12(1) takes precedence over the general provision in Order 43 rule 5(1)(cc). The court would construe the provision in Order 43 rule 12(1) as meaning that the option of committal for non-payment of “a judgment or order for the payment of money” has been removed from the jurisdiction of the High Court. In the instant case, the trial court was in grave and fundamental error, which error was patent on the face of the record, when it purported to enforce order 43 rule 5(1)(cc) without reference to Order 43 rule 12(1)”  It is thus clear from the judgment of the Supreme Court that Order 43 rule 12(1) of C.I. 47 had removed the jurisdiction of the High Court to commit for non-payment of a judgment or order for payment of money. Learned counsel for the respondent rightly submitted that in the context of the ex parte PPE Ltd., the applicable rule under paragraph (e) is Order 43 rule 5(1)(bb) and the deletion of paragraph (e) effaced Order 43 rule 5(1)(bb). Moreover, apart from the PPE Ltd. which has ousted the jurisdiction of the High Court to commit for non-payment of a judgment or order for payment of money, I find solace in the learned author S. Kwami Tetteh’s book (supra) which on page 1007 quoted supra also supports the view that a writ of sequestration cannot lie for the enforcement of a judgment or order for payment of money.  Furthermore, a perusal of the motion paper which I have reproduced (supra), indicate that the appellants prayed for a writ of fieri facias (fi.fa) and not a writ of sequestration. A writ of fi.fa is not the same as a writ of sequestration. The learned trial judge ought to have dismissed the motion because it was procedurally flawed. However, as earlier stated, the learned trial judge was right in proceeding to consider the merits of the application. No discretion arises in this matter. Furthermore, the trial High Court did not order the respondents to do an act within a time specified by the judgment which order was flouted and there was no order that required the respondents to abstain from doing an act which they disobeyed. Order 43 Rule 5(1)(a), (b), (aa) and (bb) of C.I. 47 did not invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. It is my considered opinion that based both on procedural ground and the law this ground of appeal ought to fail and it is hereby dismissed.  The next ground and which is the crust of this appeal is ground (ii) which states that “The learned trial judge erred in her ruling that the judgment could not be enforced against the directors and officers of the plaintiff/respondent company because they were not parties to the suit”. Learned counsel for the appellants did not agree with the Ruling of the learned trial judge that:-  “Also the Directors sought after here, were not parties to the substantive suit therefore enforcing the judgment against them will be out of tune with our legal chords since no personal liabilities have been established against them”.  Counsel’s main argument is that by the terms of Order 43 rule 5 of C.I. 47, the directors and officers of the company against whom a judgment of the court is sought to be enforced need not be parties to the suit. Counsel for the appellants therefore submitted that the trial judge’s Ruling that the directors and officers of the respondent company against whom the judgment is being enforced were not parties to the suit and dismissed the appellants’ application is not supported by any law and should be set aside. This submission is in support of the paragraphs 4 and 8 of the supplementary affidavit of the application for leave to attach properties of Directors as follows:-  “4. That I am informed and verily believe same to be true that under the laws of Ghana, the directors, officers and shareholders of the respondent company, though distinct from the respondent company can be called upon to satisfy the judgment obtained against the respondent company.  8\. That the argument that the directors and shareholders of the respondent company were not parties to the suit and cannot therefore be held personal responsible for the acts of the respondent company is wholly misconceived”.  I must state that learned counsel for the appellant’s reliance on Order 43 rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I. 47 had been settled earlier under the first ground of appeal and dismissed.  Now, it is the law that save its regulations after registration, a company has all the powers of a natural person of full capacity to undertake its authorized business. In this capacity, a company is a corporate being, which, within the bounds of the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179) and its regulations may perform all the duties of a natural person. In its own name, it can sue and be sued and it can owe and be owed legal liabilities. A company once duly incorporated is thus a separate legal personality with a capacity separate, independent and distinct from its members and persons employed by it. This is the cardinal principle of Company Law enunciated in the celebrated case of Salomon v Salomon & Company Limited \[1897\] AC 22. In the recent case of Soonboon Seo v Gateway Worship Centre \[2009\] SCGLR 278 Holding 4, the Supreme Court held succinctly that:  “It is clear from the record of appeal that, the second-plaintiff church is a company limited by guarantee and incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179). As a result, pursuant to section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963 it has all the powers of a natural person of full capacity. As such, it is a fully-fledged legal entity, with a personality separate from the natural persons forming it, and with capacity to sue and be sued in its own name. In law, the members of the company have no direct proprietary rights over its assets, the company being the sole owner of its assets. Since it is patent from the record that the subject-matter of the action was being claimed as the church’s asset rather than the joint property of the church and the first plaintiff, there was no reason why the first plaintiff should have been included as a co-claimant”.  It is noted that the appellants conceded in paragraph 4 (supra) of the supplementary affidavit that the Directors, shareholders, officers of the respondent company are distinct from the company in the instant appeal, the Directors among others thus are distinct from the respondent company which has legal personality.  However, the legal personality and its distinct from its members and or directors can be ignored by law and the veil of incorporation could be lifted or pierced to ascribe liability to various individuals or corporations in exceptional circumstances that the company was established to further fraudulent activities, defeat public convenience, justify wrong to avoid contractual liability or defend crime among others. This is known as the alter ego doctrine. Indeed, the learned trial judge stated the law correctly in her Ruling at pages 210 and 211 of the record of appeal thus:-  “I have looked at the plethora of cases that the counsel for the Directors of GHACEM rely on and also researched same and I must admit that it resonates so strongly within all these cases with clarity that a Limited Liability Company or Corporation has its legal existence apart from its Directors and members. It also echoes throughout those cases that seldom will the veil be lifted unless it can be proven in exceptional circumstances that the company has been established to further fraudulent activities to avoid contractual liability. (See the cases of MORKOR VRS KUMA (supra), OWUSU VRS R. N. THORNE (supra), SALOMON (supra), SOONBOON SEO (supra) etc.). It is not the law that, simply because judgment debts remain unpaid by a subsidiary company the mother company or directors must be held responsible …. In the present circumstances I am of the humble view that the applicants have not measured up to the mark by establishing any such wrong conduct on the part of Plaintiff Company nor its directors to enable the veil to be lifted”.  Was the learned trial judge right in dismissing the appellants’ application to hold the Directors liable to pierce the veil in aid of execution? Indeed the learned trial judge cited all the relevant legal authorities in arriving at her decision. In Morkor v Kuma (East Coast Fisheries case) \[1998-99\] SCGLR 620, the alter ego doctrine was discussed by the Supreme Court and this guided the learned trial judge in her ruling. In this case the plaintiff entered into a sale. The sale agreement was negotiated and witnessed by the 2nd defendant, the Chief Executive Officer, director and shareholder of the company. a deposit was paid by the company, which promised to pay the balance of the purchase price by the end of September 1990. The company however, defaulted in settling the balance of the purchase price. Consequently, the plaintiff, in October 1990, sued both the company and the 2nd defendant jointly in the High Court, Accra for the outstanding balance of the purchase price. Having entered appearance to the writ, both the company and the 2nd defendant filed a joint statement of defence on 20th November 1990.  In March 1991, the plaintiff applied to the High Court for leave to enter summary judgment against the 2nd defendant for the outstanding sum of over US$86,000.00. The defendants jointly filed an affidavit in opposition. However, on24th June 1991, the High Court, in the absence of both defendants and their counsel, granted the plaintiff’ application for summary judgment for the amount claimed. Subsequently, on 19th July 1991, both the company and the 2nd defendant filed in the High Court for a stay of execution of, and an order to set aside the summary judgment obtained against them on 24th June 1991. In the affidavit in support of the application, the 2nd defendant, for the first time, raised the issue of the propriety of her being sued jointly with the company. She averred that since the sale agreement had been executed between the plaintiff and the company and not with her personally, it was wrong for the plaintiff to have sued her, albeit a director of the company, jointly with the company. she also averred that an amount of US$24,427.00 had, in fact been paid to the plaintiff but that amount had not been credited in favour of the company so as to reduce the outstanding debt of the company before the grant of the summary judgment.  The High Court dismissed the application and her appeal against the decision of the High Court to this Court was also dismissed by a majority decision. One of the grounds on which this court dismissed the appeal was that the circumstance of the case justified the lifting of the veil of incorporation surrounding the company and that both the company and the 2nd defendant could be held personally liable together with the 1st defendant company for the outstanding debts of the company.  Not satisfied with the decision of this court, the 2nd defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.  Counsel for the plaintiff argued in support of the decision of this court among others that the 2nd defendant had been sued because she was the chief executive who directed the day to day affairs of the defendant company.  The Supreme Court held among others that since the 2nd defendant had been sued jointly with the company, a limited liability company for the only reason that she was the chief executive, main shareholder and a director of the company, she would be a proper party to the suit only if a specified personal liability were established against her or the veil of incorporation could be lifted to make her acts synonymous with those of the defendant company or vice versa. The Supreme Court considered whether or not a circumstance justifying the lifting of the veil existed depended on the peculiar facts driving each particular case. It however, pointed out that the mere fact that the 2nd defendant was at all times a shareholder, director and manager of the company was not enough to make her personally liable. The Supreme Court reacted to the statement of case by counsel for the 2nd plaintiff who explained that the 2nd defendant was joined “so as to ensure that the respondent collects his money”, the court stated that allowing the veil to be lifted to achieve such and end would mean that “every time a company defaults in the settlement of debts, any person who combines the role of chief executive, shareholder and director would, ipso facto, become personally liable. This would defeat the very essence of business incorporation”. See Akoto v Akoto \[2011\], SCGLR 533 Holding (3). See also Soonboon Seo v Gateway Worship Centre (supra), Owusu v R. N. Thorne Ltd. & Another \[1966\] GLR 90, Vicentia Aku Abusa & Ors. v A. K. Deku \[2012\] 48 GMJ 186 CA.  In the light of the authorities, it is clear that a court would not remove the veil of incorporation on the strength of mere assertions which cannot be strongly proved. Indeed, in the instant appeal, the learned trial judge held that mandatorily, any wrongdoing on the part of the company must be established to enable the court lift the veil in order that the ugly face of the erring company is seen. The trial judge further concluded that the appellants did not measure up to the mark by establishing any such wrong conduct on the part of the respondent company nor its directors to enable the veil to be lifted.  In the instant appeal, the reasons given by the appellants for their application in the affidavit in support to have the veil lifted were among others that the respondents have willfully refused or neglected to pay the judgment debt, that they have not sighted any valuable movable and immovable properties to attach, that the directors/shareholders have sufficient funds and or properties but have willfully refused to pay, that the directors are aware of the judgment debt but continued filing applications to delay and thereby frustrate the appellants from realizing the full compliments of the judgment of the court and therefore the Directors, shareholders and other officers of the respondents should be attached.  A perusal of the supplementary affidavit filed by the appellants reveal similar sentiments. A perusal of the grounds on which the appellants wanted the veil of incorporation to be lifted to make the directors to pay the judgment debt are baseless and flawed. There is no evidence that the respondents have established the company to further fraudulent activities or to avoid contractual liability, or have breached the Companies Act, Act 179 among others. From the record of appeal therefore the learned trial judge was right in dismissing the application since no evidence was established to prove that the company was established to further fraudulent activities among others. This ground of appeal fails and it is dismissed as misconceived and incompetent.  I now consider ground (iii) that is “The learned trial judge erred in her failure to give separate Rulings in respect of the application filed by the appellants herein and another application filed by the 3rd defendants seeking to pierce the Corporate Veil in aid of execution filed on 4/7/2016”. Learned Counsel for the appellants contended that the purpose of the two applications was aimed at levying execution against Ghacem Limited and the Directors of the respondent Company, the Trial judge ought to have given separate Rulings on the two applications having regards to the fact that they were filed by different parties and under different Rules of Court. Counsel submitted that it is trite that in situations where cases are even consolidated separate judgments are delivered and that the delivery of a single Ruling in respect of two separate applications initiated by different parties was wrong and amounted to travesty of justice. The learned trial judge resolved both applications in the same ruling at page 209 of the Ruling as follows:-  “I intend to resolve the two applications before this Court i.e. the application on Notice for Leave to attach the Properties of the Directors of GHACEM Ltd. or other officers of the company and that as well to pierce the corporate veil in aid of execution simultaneously. The reason being that they are two sides of the same coin, and with the sole aim of going into execution against GHACEM or its named directors as brought to court. I have studied the respective affidavits filed in support and in opposition to the applications. Likewise I have paid great heed to the learned submissions made by counsel in the matter”  Before I address this ground of appeal, I must state that the appellants complaint that the trial judge was influenced by the submission of counsel for the Directors and Ghacem Limited that the respondent company was distinct from its directors and was unjust to pierce the veil of incorporation merely because the respondent company was unable to settle its debt had been dealt with under ground (ii) and it would be superfluous to do so. Now it is trite that suits initiated separately could be consolidated and dealt with within one judgment and ruling because of their communalities. In the case of Ghana Bar Association & ors v A-G & Anor; Richard Sky v A-G, Kwasi Danso-Acheampong v A-G (Consolidated) \[2017\] 112 GMJ 1 rightly cited by counsel for the respondents, the Supreme Court per Atuguba JSC when confronted with three different suits which were consolidated delivered a single judgment at page 25 as follows:-  “These three suits were separately initiated but by reason of certain basic commonalities between them were subsequently consolidated by the court. We now proceed to dispose of them seriatim”.  Moreover, two motions can be heard together and a single ruling delivered provided the two motions are inextricably intertwined. In Re Yendi Skin Affairs; Yakubu II v Abudulai \[1984-86\] 2 GLR 239 SC, the Supreme Court heard two motions, one for stay of execution pending appeal and the other for injunction pending appeal but a single ruling was delivered. The Supreme Court spoke through Adade JSC (as he then was) as follows:-  “Civil Motion No. 9/85 is an application by Na Yakubu II, the appellant herein, for an order that execution of the judgment of the Court of Appeal (see In Re Yendi Skin Affairs; Abudulai v Yakubu  \[1984-86\] 2 GLR 189 CA) be stayed pending appeal. It is brought under rule 20 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1970 (C.I. 13). Civil Motion No. 13/86 is an application by Mahamadu Abudulai, the respondent in the appeal, asking this court to restrain by injunction, Na Yakubu II, the appellant.  “from putting himself as Ya-Na in any name whatsoever and in particular that the said Na Yakubu II shall:  1\. Forthwith vacate from, and cease to reside at the Ya-Na’s place at Yendi.  2\. Refrain from appointing and/or installing any chief or Gbon Lavia in Dagbon; and  3\. Not make any assurance whatsoever and howsoever of any land in Dagbon vested in the Ya-Na”.  As can be seen, the two motions are inextricably intertwined: Motion No. 9/85 is asking that the enforcement of the orders of the Court of Appeal be suspended while No. 13/86 is contrawise, requesting that the said orders be substantially enforced against the appellant, by restraining him from exercising and enjoying some important chiefly powers and privileges inherent in his office as Ya-Na. In the event the two motions were taken together and argued together. In this ruling, in order to avoid confusion, unless otherwise indicated, Ya-Na II will be referred to throughout as the applicant, and Mahamadu Abudulai as the respondent, notwithstanding the particular application being commented upon”.  It is thus a principle of law that a single judgment or ruling could be delivered in consolidated case provided there are commonalities between them and a single ruling could be delivered in several motions provided they are intertwined. In the instant appeal therefore, the learned trial judge was right in hearing both applications and delivered a single ruling. This ground of appeal fails as it is frivolous and it is hereby dismissed.  Having adequately dealt with grounds (i), (ii) and (iii), I deem it unnecessary to consider ground (iv), which in itself does not arise in this appeal.  In conclusion, the appeal is dismissed as unmeritorious. The Ruling of the High Court, Commercial Division dated the 24th day of January, 2017 is hereby affirmed.  (SGD.)  C. J.

"JUDGMENT  By a writ of summons issued in January 2012, the plaintiffs seek:  a. A declaration that plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum of GH₵552,146.46 being fee claim for work done for the 2nd defendant sector Ministry on renovation and redecoration of UNDP flats at Cantonments  b. Interest on GH₵552,146.46 at the prevailing bank lending rate from April, 2003 to date of final payment.  c. General damages for breach of contract.  d. Costs including lawyer’s fees.  e. Any just and equitable reliefs.  After the close of pleadings and the inability of the parties to settle at pre-trial, the matter was set down for hearing at which the parties gave evidence per their representatives and closed their cases.  From the statement of claim filed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that the 2nd defendant, per a letter dated the 25th March 2002, informed the 1st plaintiff of the 2nd defendant’s intention to rehabilitate the UNDP block of flats situate at Cantonments. The court finds that by the same letter, the 2nd defendant invited the 1st plaintiff to assess the works which needed to be carried out on the said UNDP flats. Indeed these works included mechanical, electrical, masonry, and painting among others. Again the court finds that by the same letter the 2nd defendant invited the 1st plaintiff to submit estimates in respect of the costs of the rehabilitation works. Exhibit A tendered by the plaintiff attests to this finding.  From the statement of claim the court finds that in response to the 2nd defendant’s request contained in exhibit A herein the 1st plaintiff, who is a Quantity Surveyor by profession, engaged the services of X-Cell Engineering, 2nd plaintiff herein to assist the 1st plaintiff carry out the work which it had been tasked to do; and, on the 23rd August 2002 the plaintiffs submitted a report including the estimates to the 2nd defendant. This is evidenced by exhibit B tendered by the plaintiffs. Again from the statement of claim the court finds that on the 4th day of September, 2002 the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendant a Consultancy fee for the consideration of the 2nd defendant as shown by exhibit C.  The above findings of fact are all contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the statement of claim which have been admitted by the defendants in paragraph 6 of their statement of defence. The court holds that the defendants are bound by their admissions and hence the plaintiff need not give evidence in proof of these admitted allegations. See Fori vs. Ayirebi \[1966\] GLR 627 at 647.  From exhibit C the court finds that the consultancy fee which the plaintiffs levied on the 2nd defendant for the works which they discharged, by virtue of the 2nd defendant’s request per exhibit A, was in the sum of ₵67,516,350. This amount had been misquoted by the plaintiffs in paragraph 8 of their statement of claim as GH₵6,751,635.  The court finds from the evidence given by the 1st plaintiff that out of the bill, exhibit C, which was submitted to the 2nd defendant, an amount of ₵10,000,000 was paid to the plaintiffs by the 2nd defendant as shown by exhibit D. The witness for the defendant, one Yahaya Ahmed Yakubu, the Director of Housing at the 2nd defendant, admitted during cross examination on the 4th March 2015 that the ₵10,000,000 paid by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiffs does not represent payment for the full bill submitted to the 2nd defendant by the plaintiffs herein. It implies therefore that the defendants’ averment in paragraph 12 of their statement of defence that the defendants “do not owe the plaintiffs any money and that whatever work they did was fully paid for” cannot be correct.  In the opinion of the court if it is true that the defendants have fully paid for the work done by the plaintiffs then it is the duty of the defence to adduce credible evidence to prove that allegation in accordance with sections 14 and 17 of the Evidence Act 1975, NRCD 323. Thus in Ababio vs. Akwasi III \[1994-1995\] GBR 774 it was held that:  “A party whose pleading raised an issue essential to the success of the case assumed the burden of proving such issue. The burden only shifted to the \[other party\] when \[such a party\] had adduced evidence to establish the claim”  The court has also explained in the recent case of Okudzeto Ablakwa (No. 2) vs. Attorney General & Another \[2012\] 2 SCGLR 845 at 867 that  “If a person goes to court to make an allegation, the onus is on him to lead evidence to prove that allegation, unless the allegation is admitted. If he fails to do that, the ruling on that allegation will go against him. Stated more explicitly, a party cannot win a case in court if the case is based on an allegation which he fails to prove or establish. This rule is further buttressed by section 17 (b) which, emphasizes on the party on whom lies the duty to start leading evidence…”  From the evidence adduced the court holds that the defendants have failed to prove that they do not owe the plaintiffs for the works done by the plaintiffs on the instructions of the 2nd defendant. The court is satisfied from the pleadings and the evidence on record that the defendants are indebted to the plaintiffs for the works which the plaintiffs executed for the defendants based on the request which the 2nd defendant made to the 1st plaintiff per exhibit A.  From the endorsement on the writ of summons, it is clear that the plaintiffs are not claiming, as part of their reliefs, the difference between the bill in exhibit C which is ₵67,516,350 and the amount actually paid to them by the defendants which is stated to be ₵10,000,000. By calculation the difference will be ₵57,516,350 which translates into GH₵5,752. However, notwithstanding the failure of the plaintiffs in couching a claim for the difference as stated herein, there are authorities to the effect that once there is evidence on record in support of the said claim, the court has power to give judgment in favour of the claim. See In re Gomoa Ajumako Paramount Stool; Acquah vs. Apaa \[1998-1999\] SCGLR 312;  Hanna Assi (No.2) vs. Gihoc Refrigeration & Household Production Ltd (No.2) \[2007-2008\] SCGLR  Consequently, judgment will be entered for the plaintiffs against the defendants in the sum of  ₵57,516,350 which is the same as GH₵5,752. Plus interest at the current bank rate from 4th September, 2002 to the date of final payment.  In addition to the works done by the plaintiffs on the strength of exhibit A, the court finds that on the 27th February 2003, the 2nd defendant again authorized the 1st plaintiff to “prepare tendering documents prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats with the view to rectifying electrical, mechanical, structural and architectural defects to upgrade the standard of the flats to attract higher rental value”. Further, the 2nd defendant authorized the 1st plaintiff to prepare and present to it, Bills of  Quantities for the consideration of the 2nd defendant. These facts which are supported by exhibit E tendered by the plaintiffs are pleaded in paragraph 9 of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. Not surprisingly, the defendants have admitted these facts in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence.  The court finds that in response to the 2nd defendant’s letter of 27th February 2003 the 1st plaintiff wrote an acknowledgement dated 28th February 2003, exhibit F herein and undertook to present to the 2nd defendant detailed Bills of Quantities for its consideration.  Following these exchanges, the court finds that the plaintiffs prepared various drawings and Bills of Quantities as shown by exhibits G, G1 to G21 and submitted them to the 2nd defendant. The court finds from the evidence on record that as a result of the works done by the plaintiffs, the 2nd defendant initiated processes leading to the award of contract to Messrs China State Hualong Construction (Gh.) Ltd. to undertake the works. Exhibits H, J, K, L, M, T and U attest to this fact.  The court finds that following the works done by the plaintiffs a bill, exhibit V herein, was submitted by the plaintiffs to the 2nd defendant for payment to the plaintiffs, consultancy fee of GH₵552,141.46.  The defendants say that they are not indebted to the plaintiffs for the reason that the plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence of a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. Indeed, in their evidence in chief and throughout the trial, the defendants’ defence is that there is no contract between them and the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs have failed to furnish documentary evidence of any contract between the parties so the defendants are not indebted to the plaintiffs.  The defendants’ contention that the plaintiffs “have failed to produce any evidence of any alleged contractual relationship with the Ministry” comes to the court as a great surprise. This is so because, as pointed out above, the defendants have, in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence, admitted that the 2nd defendant wrote exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff in which the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering. In the opinion of the court the language used in exhibit E makes that letter an offer to the 1st plaintiff. The authors in Chitty on Contracts (28th ed.) published by Sweet and Maxwell (1999) Vol. 1 page 90 para. 2-002 defines an offer  “as an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed’  According to the authors,  “Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intention to be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention”  In her book The Law of Contract in Ghana (2011), published by Frontiers Printing and Publishing Company, Ghana the learned author, Dowuona-Hammond, states at para. 2 page 18 that  “an offer may be defined as a statement or conduct indicating a willingness to contract on terms stated or on terms which can reasonably be inferred from conduct, and made with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted”  In NTHC Ltd vs. Antwi \[2009\] SCGLR 117 at 125 the Supreme Court stated that:  “an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms”  The court is of the opinion that once it is shown that the 1st plaintiff either accepted, in writing, the terms in exhibit E or acted upon the directives in exhibit E, a contract can legitimately be inferred. See Fofie vs. Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475.  Indeed, in the instant case, not only did the 1st plaintiff accept the terms in exhibit E by writing exhibit F to the 2nd defendant but the 1st and the 2nd plaintiffs went ahead to perform the obligations imposed on them by exhibit E by the preparation and submission to the 2nd defendant exhibits G series. Thus, by writing and by conduct, the 1st plaintiff accepted the terms of exhibit E. The court therefore holds that there exist a contract between, at least, the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.  The defendants have strenuously argued that there was no formal agreement between the parties and that the procedure set out in the Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) was not observed. The court finds it difficult to appreciate what the defendants meant by formal agreement. The court is, however, of the opinion that exhibits E and F constitute a formal contract between the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. There is no law that a formal contract between parties must be contained in one document. Once the parties have exchanged documents detailing the terms of their agreement, the documents together constitute the contract between the parties.  Even if the contract was just a verbal one it could still be enforced. At common law contracts could be formal or informal and except a statute specifically says so, contracts entered into by verbal agreements are enforceable. For instance, there is a specific requirement under section 14 of the Contracts Act 1960, Act 25 that makes it mandatory that a contract of guarantee must be in writing and signed by the guarantor in order to be valid. Again, as an example, the Conveyancing Act 1975, NRCD 175 provides in section 2 as follows  “A contract for the transfer of an interest in land is not enforceable unless  (a) it is evidenced in a writing signed by the person against whom the contract is to be proved or by a person who was authorised to sign on behalf of that person, or  (b) it is relieved against the need for a writing by section 3.”  Even then, in Fofie vs. Zanyo (supra) it was pointed out at page 477 of the report that  “The court was entitled in certain cases to permit a contract to be proved by oral evidence, even though of a kind required to be proved in writing, when the party seeking to enforce the contract had done acts in performance of his obligations under it. The court would exercise its discretion where (a) the act of part performance was referable to only the contract alleged; (b) they were such as would render it a fraud in the defendant to take advantage of the contract not being in writing; (c) the contract by its own nature was enforceable by the court; and (d) there had to be proper parol evidence of the contract let in by the act of part performance.”  In the instant case however, the contract between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendant was not oral but in writing as shown by exhibits E and F. At any rate at the time the parties entered into the agreement, there was no specific law that such contracts ought to be in writing before they could be enforced or recognized at law. As was held in Kobaku Associates vs. Owusu \[2003-2005\] 1 GLR 611  “A contract between an architect and a client was not required to be in writing and therefore under section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 (Act 25) would not be void simply because it was not written. Moreover, on the authorities, where there was no express contract with architects (and engineers) the right to remuneration was implied by the request and acceptance of the plans produced, except where there was evidence that the plans were to be merely submitted for approval, in which case they were deemed to be probationary drawing constituting an offer from the architect. And as soon as the plans were accepted the right to remuneration would arise.”  As explained, it is only when one could find a statute requiring that a particular type of contract must be in writing that a written contract becomes mandatory for the enforcement of that particular type of contracts. Hence, in the absence of a statute making it mandatory for particular contracts to be in writing, agreements verbally reached by parties, all other requirements being present, are as enforceable as their written counterparts. Indeed, that is the essence of section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 Act 25 when it states that  “11. Contracts need not be in writing except in certain cases Subject to this Act, and to any other enactment, a contract whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, is not void or unenforceable by reason only that it is not in writing or that there is no memorandum or note of the contract in writing.”  As already indicated above, the plaintiffs had proved, by exhibits G series, among others, that they had discharged their obligations under the contract. Indeed, exhibits G series were prepared only in response to the request by the 2nd defendant contained in exhibit E that the 1st plaintiff prepares Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering.  One may legitimately ask whether it would not be fraudulent on the part of the defendants to refuse to pay the plaintiffs, after benefiting from the works executed by the plaintiffs, on the ground that there is no agreement just because the terms are not contained in a single document.  Section 26 of the Evidence Act 1975 NRCD 323 is apt on this issue. It states that  “Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule of equity, when a party has, by that party’s own statement, act or omission, intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon that belief, the truth of the thing shall be conclusively presumed against that party or the successors in interest of that party in proceedings between  (a) that party or the successors in interest of that party, and  (b) the relying person or successors in interest of that person.”  The defendants have admitted writing exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff. In exhibit E the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tendering Documents “prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats…” and also “present detailed Bills of Quantities for consideration” The 1st plaintiff, in response, wrote exhibit F and thereafter, together with 2nd plaintiff prepared and submitted to 2nd defendant, exhibits G series in the discharge of their obligations under exhibit E. The relevant portion of exhibit G in particular states as follows:  “REHABILITATION OF UNDP FLATS  We refer to your letter dated 27th February 2003 and wish to inform you that Tender documents for the above project are ready.  We forward herewith one (1) copy each of the Approximate Bills of Quantities for your study and further direction”  In the opinion of the court it would be fraudulent in the defendant to say that they would not pay the plaintiffs because there is absence of a single document containing the terms of the plaintiffs’ engagement. The defendants are surely estopped by their conduct.  The defendants have argued that the plaintiffs did not go through the laid down procedures in obtaining the contract and that the proper authority did not authorize the execution of the contract. The defendants have, in their addresses, made reference to the need for an advertisement in the newspapers inviting tenders, the need for the plaintiffs to submit their bids, the need for evaluation and other procedures which should have been gone through before the award of the contract. Unfortunately, the defendants failed to mention the law which requires all these procedures to be followed before such contracts are awarded.  The question is that even if there was in existence any such law, is it only the plaintiffs who failed to comply with it? Are the defendants, particularly, is the 2nd defendant not guilty of its breach just as the plaintiff? And if so, why should the 2nddefendant be permitted to keep the benefit of its breach, by enjoying the services rendered by the plaintiffs whiles the plaintiffs suffer from an alleged breach by being denied payment for the works done by them at the promptings of the 2nd defendant? Where is the equity and good conscience in such a step? In the opinion of the court it would be unfair, unjust, inequitable, and unconscionable to deprive the plaintiffs of their remuneration.  It seems to the court that the defendant had in mind the Public Procurement Act, 2003 Act 663, which sets out in part six, sections 66 to 77, the methods and procedures to be followed before the services of Consultants were engaged by agencies and departments of Government. It ought however to be pointed out that Act 663 received Presidential assent after the contract, subject of this suit, had been entered and for that matter this Act does not operate retrospectively to regulate the contract, subject matter of this suit.  Another issue which engaged the attention of the defendants at the trial was the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had, in effect, argued that the fee payable to the plaintiffs, being the consideration for the works done, was not known at the time the parties entered the agreement and so there was no contract upon which the plaintiffs could sue. The plaintiffs’ explanation, which the defendants did not challenge and which the court has also no reason to reject, is that the Ministry of Works and Housing has a scale of fees, expressed as a percentage of the value of the contract sum and that whenever a contract was awarded the Consultants are presumed to have accepted the scale of fees agreed and approved by the Ministry.  The amount endorsed on the writ and claimed by the plaintiffs is GH₵552,146.46. This claim is supported by exhibit V the bill of fees which the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendants for payment. It appears that when the defendants disputed the fees, the plaintiffs obtained an assessment of their fees from the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, exhibit X herein which fixed the plaintiffs’ fees at US$265,666.52. The defendants also obtained an assessment of the plaintiffs’ fees from the Architectural and Engineering Services Limited, exhibit 1 herein, which fixed the fees at US$181,778.94.  Apart from there being no reason for the court to accept any of the fees quoted in exhibits X and 1, over the fees being claimed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that a conservative conversion of the amounts quoted in these exhibits from the dollar into the Ghana Cedis would far exceed the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. It therefore makes good sense to accept the amount endorsed on the writ.  There is yet one final issue which, although was not specifically raised by the defendants, the court wishes to discuss before concluding on this matter. At paragraph 1 of the statement of claim, the 1st plaintiff describes itself as a “sole proprietorship”, yet the writ is issued in the name of the 1st plaintiff which is only a business name which lacks capacity to sue as if it were a legal entity. The court is of the view that it has enough powers to effect an amendment of the capacity in which the 1st plaintiff had sued in order that the real issue in controversy between the parties is determined and not defeated by a mere technicality. Indeed, Order 16 rule 7 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2004, CI. 47, gives the court the power to amend suo motu. It provides that  “7. Amendment of other documents  (1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties or of correcting any defect or error in the proceedings, the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings either of its own motion or on the application of any party, order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner as it may direct.  (2) This rule shall not apply in relation to a judgment or order.”  This rule had long been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority vs. Issoufou \[1993-1994\] 1 GLR 24 where the court reiterated the law that  “The courts had a duty to ensure that justice was done in cases before them and should not let that duty be circumvented by mere technicalities. Since the power to make amendments to the capacity of a party rested in the inherent jurisdiction of the courts, the courts could, when the issue was raised either in the trial court any time after judgment was delivered or in the appellate court on the application of a party to the suit, orally or otherwise, grant such amendments as were necessary to meet the justice of the case.”  The evidence before the court shows that the 1st plaintiff is owned and operated by Yaw Banning Darko who describes himself as the Chief Executive Officer of the 1st plaintiff. Indeed all the correspondence from the 1st plaintiff, which was tendered in evidence, was signed by Yaw Banning Darko.  On the strength of the authorities therefore the writ will be amended by amending the name of the 1st plaintiff to read “Yaw Banning Darko operating under the name Dakab Consult.”  Finally, the court holds that the plaintiffs are entitled to their claims against the defendants. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiffs to recover from the defendants the sum of GH₵552,146.46 together with interest at the prevailing rate from 18th May 2011, the date on which the 1st plaintiff wrote his bill to the 2nd defendant to the date of final payment. Judgment is also entered for the plaintiff to recover the unpaid balance of their bill in respect of the earlier works executed by them as already stated in this judgment. Costs of GH₵2,500 to the plaintiffs against the defendants.  By a writ of summons issued in January 2012, the plaintiffs seek:  a. A declaration that plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum of GH₵552,146.46 being fee claim for work done for the 2nd defendant sector Ministry on renovation and redecoration of UNDP flats at Cantonments  b. Interest on GH₵552,146.46 at the prevailing bank lending rate from April, 2003 to date of final payment.  c. General damages for breach of contract.  d. Costs including lawyer’s fees.  e. Any just and equitable reliefs.  After the close of pleadings and the inability of the parties to settle at pre-trial, the matter was set down for hearing at which the parties gave evidence per their representatives and closed their cases.  From the statement of claim filed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that the 2nd defendant, per a letter dated the 25th March 2002, informed the 1st plaintiff of the 2nd defendant’s intention to rehabilitate the UNDP block of flats situate at Cantonments. The court finds that by the same letter, the 2nd defendant invited the 1st plaintiff to assess the works which needed to be carried out on the said UNDP flats. Indeed these works included mechanical, electrical, masonry, and painting among others. Again the court finds that by the same letter the 2nd defendant invited the 1st plaintiff to submit estimates in respect of the costs of the rehabilitation works. Exhibit A tendered by the plaintiff attests to this finding.  From the statement of claim the court finds that in response to the 2nd defendant’s request contained in exhibit A herein the 1st plaintiff, who is a Quantity Surveyor by profession, engaged the services of X-Cell Engineering, 2nd plaintiff herein to assist the 1st plaintiff carry out the work which it had been tasked to do; and, on the 23rd August 2002 the plaintiffs submitted a report including the estimates to the 2nd defendant. This is evidenced by exhibit B tendered by the plaintiffs. Again from the statement of claim the court finds that on the 4th day of September, 2002 the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendant a Consultancy fee for the consideration of the 2nd defendant as shown by exhibit C.  The above findings of fact are all contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the statement of claim which have been admitted by the defendants in paragraph 6 of their statement of defence. The court holds that the defendants are bound by their admissions and hence the plaintiff need not give evidence in proof of these admitted allegations. See Fori vs. Ayirebi \[1966\] GLR 627 at 647.  From exhibit C the court finds that the consultancy fee which the plaintiffs levied on the 2nd defendant for the works which they discharged, by virtue of the 2nd defendant’s request per exhibit A, was in the sum of ₵67,516,350. This amount had been misquoted by the plaintiffs in paragraph 8 of their statement of claim as GH₵6,751,635.  The court finds from the evidence given by the 1st plaintiff that out of the bill, exhibit C, which was submitted to the 2nd defendant, an amount of ₵10,000,000 was paid to the plaintiffs by the 2nd defendant as shown by exhibit D. The witness for the defendant, one Yahaya Ahmed Yakubu, the Director of Housing at the 2nd defendant, admitted during cross examination on the 4th March 2015 that the ₵10,000,000 paid by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiffs does not represent payment for the full bill submitted to the 2nd defendant by the plaintiffs herein. It implies therefore that the defendants’ averment in paragraph 12 of their statement of defence that the defendants “do not owe the plaintiffs any money and that whatever work they did was fully paid for” cannot be correct.  In the opinion of the court if it is true that the defendants have fully paid for the work done by the plaintiffs then it is the duty of the defence to adduce credible evidence to prove that allegation in accordance with sections 14 and 17 of the Evidence Act 1975, NRCD 323. Thus in Ababio vs. Akwasi III \[1994-1995\] GBR 774 it was held that:  “A party whose pleading raised an issue essential to the success of the case assumed the burden of proving such issue. The burden only shifted to the \[other party\] when \[such a party\] had adduced evidence to establish the claim”  The court has also explained in the recent case of Okudzeto Ablakwa (No. 2) vs. Attorney General & Another \[2012\] 2 SCGLR 845 at 867 that  “If a person goes to court to make an allegation, the onus is on him to lead evidence to prove that allegation, unless the allegation is admitted. If he fails to do that, the ruling on that allegation will go against him. Stated more explicitly, a party cannot win a case in court if the case is based on an allegation which he fails to prove or establish. This rule is further buttressed by section 17 (b) which, emphasizes on the party on whom lies the duty to start leading evidence…”  From the evidence adduced the court holds that the defendants have failed to prove that they do not owe the plaintiffs for the works done by the plaintiffs on the instructions of the 2nd defendant. The court is satisfied from the pleadings and the evidence on record that the defendants are indebted to the plaintiffs for the works which the plaintiffs executed for the defendants based on the request which the 2nd defendant made to the 1st plaintiff per exhibit A.  From the endorsement on the writ of summons, it is clear that the plaintiffs are not claiming, as part of their reliefs, the difference between the bill in exhibit C which is ₵67,516,350 and the amount actually paid to them by the defendants which is stated to be ₵10,000,000. By calculation the difference will be ₵57,516,350 which translates into GH₵5,752. However, notwithstanding the failure of the plaintiffs in couching a claim for the difference as stated herein, there are authorities to the effect that once there is evidence on record in support of the said claim, the court has power to give judgment in favour of the claim. See In re Gomoa Ajumako Paramount Stool; Acquah vs. Apaa \[1998-1999\] SCGLR 312;  Hanna Assi (No.2) vs. Gihoc Refrigeration & Household Production Ltd (No.2) \[2007-2008\] SCGLR  Consequently, judgment will be entered for the plaintiffs against the defendants in the sum of  ₵57,516,350 which is the same as GH₵5,752. Plus interest at the current bank rate from 4th September, 2002 to the date of final payment.  In addition to the works done by the plaintiffs on the strength of exhibit A, the court finds that on the 27th February 2003, the 2nd defendant again authorized the 1st plaintiff to “prepare tendering documents prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats with the view to rectifying electrical, mechanical, structural and architectural defects to upgrade the standard of the flats to attract higher rental value”. Further, the 2nd defendant authorized the 1st plaintiff to prepare and present to it, Bills of  Quantities for the consideration of the 2nd defendant. These facts which are supported by exhibit E tendered by the plaintiffs are pleaded in paragraph 9 of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. Not surprisingly, the defendants have admitted these facts in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence.  The court finds that in response to the 2nd defendant’s letter of 27th February 2003 the 1st plaintiff wrote an acknowledgement dated 28th February 2003, exhibit F herein and undertook to present to the 2nd defendant detailed Bills of Quantities for its consideration.  Following these exchanges, the court finds that the plaintiffs prepared various drawings and Bills of Quantities as shown by exhibits G, G1 to G21 and submitted them to the 2nd defendant. The court finds from the evidence on record that as a result of the works done by the plaintiffs, the 2nd defendant initiated processes leading to the award of contract to Messrs China State Hualong Construction (Gh.) Ltd. to undertake the works. Exhibits H, J, K, L, M, T and U attest to this fact.  The court finds that following the works done by the plaintiffs a bill, exhibit V herein, was submitted by the plaintiffs to the 2nd defendant for payment to the plaintiffs, consultancy fee of GH₵552,141.46.  The defendants say that they are not indebted to the plaintiffs for the reason that the plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence of a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. Indeed, in their evidence in chief and throughout the trial, the defendants’ defence is that there is no contract between them and the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs have failed to furnish documentary evidence of any contract between the parties so the defendants are not indebted to the plaintiffs.  The defendants’ contention that the plaintiffs “have failed to produce any evidence of any alleged contractual relationship with the Ministry” comes to the court as a great surprise. This is so because, as pointed out above, the defendants have, in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence, admitted that the 2nd defendant wrote exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff in which the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering. In the opinion of the court the language used in exhibit E makes that letter an offer to the 1st plaintiff. The authors in Chitty on Contracts (28th ed.) published by Sweet and Maxwell (1999) Vol. 1 page 90 para. 2-002 defines an offer  “as an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed’  According to the authors,  “Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intention to be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention”  In her book The Law of Contract in Ghana (2011), published by Frontiers Printing and Publishing Company, Ghana the learned author, Dowuona-Hammond, states at para. 2 page 18 that  “an offer may be defined as a statement or conduct indicating a willingness to contract on terms stated or on terms which can reasonably be inferred from conduct, and made with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted”  In NTHC Ltd vs. Antwi \[2009\] SCGLR 117 at 125 the Supreme Court stated that:  “an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms”  The court is of the opinion that once it is shown that the 1st plaintiff either accepted, in writing, the terms in exhibit E or acted upon the directives in exhibit E, a contract can legitimately be inferred. See Fofie vs. Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475.  Indeed, in the instant case, not only did the 1st plaintiff accept the terms in exhibit E by writing exhibit F to the 2nd defendant but the 1st and the 2nd plaintiffs went ahead to perform the obligations imposed on them by exhibit E by the preparation and submission to the 2nd defendant exhibits G series. Thus, by writing and by conduct, the 1st plaintiff accepted the terms of exhibit E. The court therefore holds that there exist a contract between, at least, the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.  The defendants have strenuously argued that there was no formal agreement between the parties and that the procedure set out in the Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) was not observed. The court finds it difficult to appreciate what the defendants meant by formal agreement. The court is, however, of the opinion that exhibits E and F constitute a formal contract between the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. There is no law that a formal contract between parties must be contained in one document. Once the parties have exchanged documents detailing the terms of their agreement, the documents together constitute the contract between the parties.  Even if the contract was just a verbal one it could still be enforced. At common law contracts could be formal or informal and except a statute specifically says so, contracts entered into by verbal agreements are enforceable. For instance, there is a specific requirement under section 14 of the Contracts Act 1960, Act 25 that makes it mandatory that a contract of guarantee must be in writing and signed by the guarantor in order to be valid. Again, as an example, the Conveyancing Act 1975, NRCD 175 provides in section 2 as follows  “A contract for the transfer of an interest in land is not enforceable unless  (a) it is evidenced in a writing signed by the person against whom the contract is to be proved or by a person who was authorised to sign on behalf of that person, or  (b) it is relieved against the need for a writing by section 3.”  Even then, in Fofie vs. Zanyo (supra) it was pointed out at page 477 of the report that  “The court was entitled in certain cases to permit a contract to be proved by oral evidence, even though of a kind required to be proved in writing, when the party seeking to enforce the contract had done acts in performance of his obligations under it. The court would exercise its discretion where (a) the act of part performance was referable to only the contract alleged; (b) they were such as would render it a fraud in the defendant to take advantage of the contract not being in writing; (c) the contract by its own nature was enforceable by the court; and (d) there had to be proper parol evidence of the contract let in by the act of part performance.”  In the instant case however, the contract between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendant was not oral but in writing as shown by exhibits E and F. At any rate at the time the parties entered into the agreement, there was no specific law that such contracts ought to be in writing before they could be enforced or recognized at law. As was held in Kobaku Associates vs. Owusu \[2003-2005\] 1 GLR 611  “A contract between an architect and a client was not required to be in writing and therefore under section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 (Act 25) would not be void simply because it was not written. Moreover, on the authorities, where there was no express contract with architects (and engineers) the right to remuneration was implied by the request and acceptance of the plans produced, except where there was evidence that the plans were to be merely submitted for approval, in which case they were deemed to be probationary drawing constituting an offer from the architect. And as soon as the plans were accepted the right to remuneration would arise.”  As explained, it is only when one could find a statute requiring that a particular type of contract must be in writing that a written contract becomes mandatory for the enforcement of that particular type of contracts. Hence, in the absence of a statute making it mandatory for particular contracts to be in writing, agreements verbally reached by parties, all other requirements being present, are as enforceable as their written counterparts. Indeed, that is the essence of section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 Act 25 when it states that  “11. Contracts need not be in writing except in certain cases Subject to this Act, and to any other enactment, a contract whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, is not void or unenforceable by reason only that it is not in writing or that there is no memorandum or note of the contract in writing.”  As already indicated above, the plaintiffs had proved, by exhibits G series, among others, that they had discharged their obligations under the contract. Indeed, exhibits G series were prepared only in response to the request by the 2nd defendant contained in exhibit E that the 1st plaintiff prepares Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering.  One may legitimately ask whether it would not be fraudulent on the part of the defendants to refuse to pay the plaintiffs, after benefiting from the works executed by the plaintiffs, on the ground that there is no agreement just because the terms are not contained in a single document.  Section 26 of the Evidence Act 1975 NRCD 323 is apt on this issue. It states that  “Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule of equity, when a party has, by that party’s own statement, act or omission, intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon that belief, the truth of the thing shall be conclusively presumed against that party or the successors in interest of that party in proceedings between  (a) that party or the successors in interest of that party, and  (b) the relying person or successors in interest of that person.”  The defendants have admitted writing exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff. In exhibit E the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tendering Documents “prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats…” and also “present detailed Bills of Quantities for consideration” The 1st plaintiff, in response, wrote exhibit F and thereafter, together with 2nd plaintiff prepared and submitted to 2nd defendant, exhibits G series in the discharge of their obligations under exhibit E. The relevant portion of exhibit G in particular states as follows:  “REHABILITATION OF UNDP FLATS  We refer to your letter dated 27th February 2003 and wish to inform you that Tender documents for the above project are ready.  We forward herewith one (1) copy each of the Approximate Bills of Quantities for your study and further direction”  In the opinion of the court it would be fraudulent in the defendant to say that they would not pay the plaintiffs because there is absence of a single document containing the terms of the plaintiffs’ engagement. The defendants are surely estopped by their conduct.  The defendants have argued that the plaintiffs did not go through the laid down procedures in obtaining the contract and that the proper authority did not authorize the execution of the contract. The defendants have, in their addresses, made reference to the need for an advertisement in the newspapers inviting tenders, the need for the plaintiffs to submit their bids, the need for evaluation and other procedures which should have been gone through before the award of the contract. Unfortunately, the defendants failed to mention the law which requires all these procedures to be followed before such contracts are awarded.  The question is that even if there was in existence any such law, is it only the plaintiffs who failed to comply with it? Are the defendants, particularly, is the 2nd defendant not guilty of its breach just as the plaintiff? And if so, why should the 2nddefendant be permitted to keep the benefit of its breach, by enjoying the services rendered by the plaintiffs whiles the plaintiffs suffer from an alleged breach by being denied payment for the works done by them at the promptings of the 2nd defendant? Where is the equity and good conscience in such a step? In the opinion of the court it would be unfair, unjust, inequitable, and unconscionable to deprive the plaintiffs of their remuneration.  It seems to the court that the defendant had in mind the Public Procurement Act, 2003 Act 663, which sets out in part six, sections 66 to 77, the methods and procedures to be followed before the services of Consultants were engaged by agencies and departments of Government. It ought however to be pointed out that Act 663 received Presidential assent after the contract, subject of this suit, had been entered and for that matter this Act does not operate retrospectively to regulate the contract, subject matter of this suit.  Another issue which engaged the attention of the defendants at the trial was the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had, in effect, argued that the fee payable to the plaintiffs, being the consideration for the works done, was not known at the time the parties entered the agreement and so there was no contract upon which the plaintiffs could sue. The plaintiffs’ explanation, which the defendants did not challenge and which the court has also no reason to reject, is that the Ministry of Works and Housing has a scale of fees, expressed as a percentage of the value of the contract sum and that whenever a contract was awarded the Consultants are presumed to have accepted the scale of fees agreed and approved by the Ministry.  The amount endorsed on the writ and claimed by the plaintiffs is GH₵552,146.46. This claim is supported by exhibit V the bill of fees which the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendants for payment. It appears that when the defendants disputed the fees, the plaintiffs obtained an assessment of their fees from the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, exhibit X herein which fixed the plaintiffs’ fees at US$265,666.52. The defendants also obtained an assessment of the plaintiffs’ fees from the Architectural and Engineering Services Limited, exhibit 1 herein, which fixed the fees at US$181,778.94.  Apart from there being no reason for the court to accept any of the fees quoted in exhibits X and 1, over the fees being claimed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that a conservative conversion of the amounts quoted in these exhibits from the dollar into the Ghana Cedis would far exceed the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. It therefore makes good sense to accept the amount endorsed on the writ.  There is yet one final issue which, although was not specifically raised by the defendants, the court wishes to discuss before concluding on this matter. At paragraph 1 of the statement of claim, the 1st plaintiff describes itself as a “sole proprietorship”, yet the writ is issued in the name of the 1st plaintiff which is only a business name which lacks capacity to sue as if it were a legal entity. The court is of the view that it has enough powers to effect an amendment of the capacity in which the 1st plaintiff had sued in order that the real issue in controversy between the parties is determined and not defeated by a mere technicality. Indeed, Order 16 rule 7 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2004, CI. 47, gives the court the power to amend suo motu. It provides that  “7. Amendment of other documents  (1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties or of correcting any defect or error in the proceedings, the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings either of its own motion or on the application of any party, order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner as it may direct.  (2) This rule shall not apply in relation to a judgment or order.”  This rule had long been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority vs. Issoufou \[1993-1994\] 1 GLR 24 where the court reiterated the law that  “The courts had a duty to ensure that justice was done in cases before them and should not let that duty be circumvented by mere technicalities. Since the power to make amendments to the capacity of a party rested in the inherent jurisdiction of the courts, the courts could, when the issue was raised either in the trial court any time after judgment was delivered or in the appellate court on the application of a party to the suit, orally or otherwise, grant such amendments as were necessary to meet the justice of the case.”  The evidence before the court shows that the 1st plaintiff is owned and operated by Yaw Banning Darko who describes himself as the Chief Executive Officer of the 1st plaintiff. Indeed all the correspondence from the 1st plaintiff, which was tendered in evidence, was signed by Yaw Banning Darko.  On the strength of the authorities therefore the writ will be amended by amending the name of the 1st plaintiff to read “Yaw Banning Darko operating under the name Dakab Consult.”  Finally, the court holds that the plaintiffs are entitled to their claims against the defendants. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiffs to recover from the defendants the sum of GH₵552,146.46 together with interest at the prevailing rate from 18th May 2011, the date on which the 1st plaintiff wrote his bill to the 2nd defendant to the date of final payment. Judgment is also entered for the plaintiff to recover the unpaid balance of their bill in respect of the earlier works executed by them as already stated in this judgment. Costs of GH₵2,500 to the plaintiffs against the defendants.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"JUDGMENT  Plaintiff claims the following reliefs endorsed on its amended writ against the defendant:  i. Specific performance.  Or in the alternative  Special damages of US$113,233.80 or its cedi equivalent of GH¢293,726.93 being the money spent on the due diligence exercise and the monies spent in the preparation for the acquisition of the controlling stake in the Defendant Company.  ii. An injunction restraining the Defendant, whether by itself or by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever, from doing the following acts or any of them, that is to say, parting or dealing with or disposing of any of its shares otherwise than to the Plaintiff.  iii. An Injunction restraining the Defendant Company from registering the transfer of the shares to any other parties than the Plaintiff.  iv. Damages for breach of contract.  v. Interest on any sum found due at such rate and for such period as the honourable court shall deem fit.  vi. Further or other reliefs.  vii. Costs.  In the statement of claim that accompanied the writ, plaintiff who glorify itself as a specialist in mortgage finance in Ghana claim to have made certain approaches to the defendant, with intent to acquiring a controlling stake in defendant’s entity. Defendant acceded to the request of Plaintiff but granted plaintiff a three month exclusivity period on 15th January, 2014, to conduct due diligence on defendant company with view to making an offer to acquiring defendant company.  Plaintiff then asseverates that it did conduct its due diligence and expended considerable amount of money running into over hundred thousand US dollars after which it did make a definite offer to defendant to acquire a majority shares in Defendant Company on the 5th of February, 2014. To defendant the offer was duly and unequivocally accepted by the defendant on the 3rd of March, 2014. Based on the acceptance of its offer it further paid monies to the tune of US$69,421.07 to a company by name Harborough Ltd to solicit for the sum of 11 million US dollars to acquire Defendant Company. Plaintiff further notes that to its dismay, defendant has called an annual general meeting and sought the approval of its shareholders for the recapitalization of defendant by its majority shareholder, being National Investment Bank (NIB). And due to that defendant seems to have resiled from the agreement it has with Plaintiff notwithstanding the remonstrations made by plaintiff.  Plaintiff then particularizes the special damage it has suffered which comes to a total of US$113,233.80 or its cedi equivalent of Ghc293, 726.93 and accordingly prays for the reliefs endorsed on the writ of summons.  STATEMENT OF DEFENCE  Defendant has denied that it is liable to be mulcted in any kind of damage or liable in law to be compelled to specifically perform any contract as there had been no contract. To defendant, Plaintiff was among a number of entities that expressed interest in acquiring shares in defendant and plaintiff was accepted subject to further negotiations and approval by the defendant’s shareholders and Bank of Ghana. Defendant further answer that plaintiff ought to have known that the board of directors of defendant do not have the mandate to accept an offer for the transfer of shares without the consent of its shareholders and bank of Ghana. Besides the share and purchase agreement that was to be prepared for signing was also never done. And as the shareholders have refused their consent there is nothing it could do and is therefore not liable for any expenses incurred by plaintiff.  As the pretrial conference failed to settle the matter between the parties the following were set down for trial by the pretrial Judge:  1\. Whether or not a contract was formed between the Plaintiff Company and the Defendant Company on the 3rd of March, 2014 when the Board of Directors sent a letter accepting the Plaintiff Company’s offer.  2\. Whether or not the Defendant breached the said contract by calling an Annual General Meeting (AGM) seeking shareholders’ approval for the recapitalization of the Defendant Company by the National Investment Bank (NIB) thereby increasing the shareholding of National Investment Bank (NIB) further when same had been offered to the Plaintiff Company.  3\. Whether or not by making an unequivocal and unconditional acceptance on the 3rd of March, 2014 of the Plaintiff Company’s offer, the Directors of the Defendant Company had represented to the Plaintiff Company that they had obtained all the necessary consent including that of the shareholders to sell and/or transfer the relevant shares to the Plaintiff Company.  4\. Whether or not contracting parties failing to execute a sale and purchase agreement between them invalidates any contract already formed.  EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW:  Being a civil trial it is well known that the party alleging a fact bears the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence, both being components of the burden of proof. See sections 11(1) and and 12 of the Evidence Act. This is put better in the Supreme Court case of ABABIO v AKWASI III \[1994-95\] GBR 774 where the court noted as follows:  “a party whose pleadings raised an issue essential to the success of his case assumed the burden of proving such issue. The burden only shifted to the defendant when the plaintiff has adduced evidence to establish the claim”  The plaintiff testified through its representative, being its internal auditor, Emmanuel McCarthy and tendered as much as twenty nine documents. Most of them had to do with its quest to show the expenses it incurred in an attempt to prove its entitlement to special damages. However, key among its documents in support of the claim of the existence of a contract having come into being include among others, the following vital documents: a letter from defendant authorizing the plaintiff to commence a due diligence exercise for two month as Ex ‘A’, Exhibits B to Z to CC are all concerned with one expenditure or the other made by plaintiff. Ex ‘DD’ and ‘EE’ will be very crucial in resolving the existence or non-existence of a contract between the parties.  Defendant on the other hand testified through its General Manager Finance & Strategy, Joseph Kyeremeh. Most of its documents had earlier been admitted into evidence through the plaintiff. But key among the documents tendered were Exhibits 1 to 8 being series of correspondence between the parties. The court is invited to determine whether there had been any contract between the parties. As plaintiff bears the burden with respect to this allegation, how did plaintiff prove this claim?  Plaintiff in its statement of claim and per the evidence of its representative had made the court aware that it had expressed the desire to own the majority of the shares of defendant. There seems to be no dispute whatsoever about this claim at all as per Ex ‘A’, defendant approved the interest shown by the plaintiff and gave plaintiff a two month period to conduct its due diligence with the aim of acquiring defendant’s company.  There is evidence that with the completion of due diligence, plaintiff wrote per Ex ‘DD’ where plaintiff details out its interest to acquire defendant and how it plans to make it a viable entity. Defendant’s response is curious and worth quoting:  “The Board of Directors of First Ghana Savings and Loans Ltd (FGSL) at its meeting on 27th February, 2014 approved your offer for the purchase of forty million ordinary shares at Ghc0.25, valued at Ghc 10 million and 57% controlling stake in FGSL.  The board also authorized the preparation of the sale and purchase agreement that should incorporate the GHL strategy after acquisition ….  We are therefore, by this letter informing you to liaise with FGSL Management for the preparation and signing of the sale and purchase agreement”.  This was positively identified by Emmanuel McCarthy as bringing a contract into being in the following exchanges:  Q. The defendant company had no agreement with your company to sell any of its shares to it  A. My Lord, there was an agreement  Q. Can you show the court or refer the court to any such agreement that was executed by the defendant company and your company  A. My Lord I recollect there was an agreement between both parties which was supposed to be spelt out in a purchase and sales agreement  Q. I am suggesting to you that the defendant company never agreed to sell its shares to the plaintiff company in any written document  A. My Lord, I disagree with your position. Ghana Home Loans made an offer to First Ghana Savings and Loans which was accepted by First Ghana Savings and Loans. So … there was an agreement”  Indeed, plaintiff’s representative, though not a lawyer, was very spot on and recognized when a binding contract comes into effect as I am about to detail infra.  A binding contract comes into effect when there had been an offer, an unequivocal acceptance that does not amount to a counter offer or leave the fundamental terms of the contract still to be negotiated for. The contract is simply the agreement and not the document that defendant has so erroneously been led by its counsel to believe.  Contract has been defined as ‘a promise or set of promises which the law will enforce’. See Frederick Pollock’s Principles of Contract: A Treatise on the General Principles Concerning the Validity of Agreements in the Law of England, 7th ed. A contract therefore comes into being when there had been an exchange of promises between two or more parties or when a promise had been given in exchange for the performance of an act. What needs to be present for any agreement to be enforceable is one whether there had been a promise by one party. This usually may be reflected in the nature of an offer. And if there is an offer whether the offer has unconditionally been accepted. And if it has been accepted whether from the nature of the whole transaction there was an intention to create legal relations.  Indeed in the case of NTHC v YAA ANTWI \[2009\] SCGLR 117 this is how the learned Justice Date-Bah defined a valid offer and acceptance in a case where Ms Antwi had communicated her acceptance of an offer to sell a house she was living in to her and had not even paid the money long after the communication:  “Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.  I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance. I find and hold that Ex ‘EE’ was an acceptance of the offer made by plaintiff and once it was communicated to the plaintiff, a valid, binding and enforceable contract had come into being.  Counsel for defendant in his address claim that approval of the offer made by plaintiff cannot be equated to acceptance and at page 5 further claim that there were many issues for the parties to agree on to be incorporated into the sale and purchase agreement. One may ask, which issues? He himself had no clue as to the issues and little wonder could not even state one for the consideration of the court.  It is clear that it is not the use of the word ‘acceptance’ that becomes a magic word such that its avoidance does not bring a valid contract into being. In any case a simple check at the synonyms of ‘approval’ will bring out the following words – acceptance, consent, assent, compliance, acquiescence, concurrence, permission, blessing, rubber stamp, endorsement, ratification, authorization, license, validation, confirmation, backing, to go ahead, green light, ok, thumb up, among many more others. This submission of learned counsel for defendant on the use of approval and not acceptance, with profound respect, was extremely pedestrian and peripheral.  For in the case of FOFIE v ZANYO \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 the Supreme Court noted, among others, that acceptance of an offer must be some form of positive evidence by words, in writing or conduct from which acceptance can reasonably be inferred, the acceptance would have to be communicated to the offeror and that there was no need for specific method of acceptance of an offer. All these are met in this case. See also NTHC v YAA ANTWI supra.  Two false claims were put up by the defendant in a weak attempt to parry off the charge of the plaintiff and it is necessary that I raise them and expose how they cannot be used as a ruse to enable the defendant escape the consequences of its civil liabilities. First is what is claimed by defendant that it approved the transaction subject to the further approval of its shareholders. Its representative states in paragraph 19 of is witness statement that “at no time during the negotiation that the shareholders of the defendant company agreed to sell their shares to the Plaintiff. The second one is what defendant claims is the need to seek the approval of the Bank of Ghana for the sale. Two were stated by Mr. Kyeremeh under cross examination in the following:  “Q: So you agree with me that your company had settled on the plaintiff’s company in respect of the acquisition of the shares.  A. My Lord as I said earlier, we needed the shareholders’ approval, and then even after the shareholders’ approval, the Banking Act and specifically the Non-banking Financial Act, 2008, Act 774, specifically states that any financial institution regulated by the Bank of Ghana need prior approval for the sale of a majority shares to individual or company. So we needed a shareholders’ approval and finally the Bank of Ghana which was not done”.  This is far from the truth. The answer of the court on non-approval of the deal by defendant’s shareholders’ can simply be answered by the rule in Turquand’s case. That is ROYAL BRITISH BANK v TURQUAND \[1843-60\] ALL ER 435. The rule is to the effect that people transacting with companies are entitled to assume that internal company rules are complied with, even if they are not. This rule was later affirmed in the case of MAHONEY v EAST HOLIFORD MINING COM. \[1975\] LR HL 869’ where Lord Hetherly noted as follows:  “When there are persons conducting the affairs of the company in a manner which appears to be perfectly consonant with the articles of association, those so dealing with them externally are not to be affected by irregularities which may take place in the internal management of the company”.  This has been the position of the Ghana’s Company, Act 179 where under section 137 it states as follows:  “A company shall act through its members in general meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by, or under authority derived from, the members in general meeting or the board of directors.  (2) Subject to the provisions of this Code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company's Regulations.  (3) Except as otherwise provided in the company's Regulations, the business of the company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting”.  I find and hold that the Board of Directors having communicated their unfettered acceptance of the offer of the plaintiff, it lies not in the mouth of the defendant to turn round to claim that their acceptance had not been approved by the shareholders’. The rule in Turquand and the Companies Act totally frown up such a defence.  Now to the claim of the transaction being subject to Bank of Ghana’s approval. The relevant portion for our dealing is section 20(1) of the Non-Banking Financial Act, Act 774 which states as follows:  “(1) A non-bank financial institution shall submit to the Bank for approval, any proposal or agreement which it intends to enter into with another party for the sale or disposal by amalgamation or otherwise of its business, or a part of its business.  (2) Subject to prior written approval of the Bank  (a) a non-bank financial institution may, other than in the ordinary course of its business, sell the whole or part of its assets in the country to another licensed non-bank financial institution”  From the evidence on record it has not been the case of the defendant that bank of Ghana did not approve the transaction. If it had not then the defendant would have pleaded frustration. The Central Bank only asked for shareholders’ approval which defendant had negligently failed to procure and why should plaintiff suffer for defendant’s own lapses when plaintiff per the Turquand’s rule was perfectly entitled in law to assume that the internal preconditions have been complied with. This ground must also fail.  Ipso facto then, the alleged holding of an annual general meeting by the defendant after a valid, binding contract had come into force does amount, to a blatant breach of the contract with the plaintiff that had come into being between the parties. I need not say more on this issue as my analysis on the first issue makes any further discussion moot.  Again, by the principle as expounded in the Torquand’s case, Mahoney, sections 137, 140 of the Companies Act, Act 179, the Board of Directors of defendant by accepting the offer of plaintiff, in law had fully represented to the plaintiff that all the necessary precondition to enable a binding contract come into being had been obtained by them.  The sections earlier quoted in Act 179 could only be supplemented by section 142 which states as follows:  “Any person having dealings with a company or with someone deriving title under the company shall be entitled to make the following assumptions, that is to say,  (a) that the company's Regulations have been duly complied with; Again see MAHONEY case supra.  Any share purchase agreement was only meant to condense and concretise the agreement that had been reached between the parties and was not meant to be what brings an agreement into being. The non-execution of the Sale Purchase Agreement does not have any effect at all on the contract that had into being.  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE  Plaintiff claims specific performance of the contract or in the alternative special damages for breach of the contract. It is trite that specific performance is an equitable relief and granted when the court finds it just and equitable to so grant it discretionary. See STICKNEY v KEEBLE \[1915\] A.C 386”419. Among some of the factors that a court will have to consider in the exercise of its discretion include, among others, the following:  1\. Whether there had been a part performance of the contract.  2\. Whether damages will not be an adequate remedy  3\. The uniqueness of the contract.  4\. Whether time was of the essence of the contract.  5\. Whether a third party in good faith has acquired right or interest in the subject matter.  6\. Whether on the whole the court finds it just and equitable to grant the application.  See the following cases: KOGLEX LTD (NO2) v FIELD \[2000\] SCGLR 175; ERIC ANSONG v ALBERT GORMAN & ANOR J4/37/2011.  Considering the gamut of all these factors, I think the existence of an alternative remedy of damages should impel the court not to grant the order of specific performance. Plaintiff had asked the alternative remedy of special damages and damages for breach of contract.  SPECIAL DAMAGES  Special damages are losses that is ordinarily not presumed by law. They are expenses incurred by party in respect of monies actually lost. They must specifically be pleaded, particularized and proved in court as they do not normally follow from ordinary cause. See BOHAM v EVONNA \[1992\] 1 GLR 287; CHAHIN & SONS v EPOPE PRINTING PRESS \[1963\] 1 GLR 163 SC. The greater part of the exhibits are all expenditure made by plaintiff in its quest to take over the defendant company.  Some were in respect of due diligence conducted before the acceptance of its offer whiles some, especially an amount of US$69,000.00 was in respect of payments to Harborough Ltd to enable plaintiff access an eleven million funds to recapitalize defendant. I have carefully checked the exhibits regarding the expenditures made and it is my view that all those monies are recoverable. As they are loss to the plaintiff that directly flows from the breach of the contract by defendant.  As the court has declined the order for specific performance it is needless also for the grant of an order of injunction to restrain the defendant from transferring the shares to any person it deems. The order for the grant of an injunction to restrain a transfer of shares is also refused.  GENERAL DAMAGES  The plaintiff also seeks for general damages for breach of contract. In the Supreme Court case of  DELMAS AGENCY GHANA LTD. V FOOD DISTRIBUTORS INTERNATIONAL LTD \[2007 – 2008\] SCGLR 748 on the award of general damages the court held that:  ‘General damages is such as the law will presume to be the natural and probable consequence of the defendant’s act. It arises by inference of the law and therefore need not be proved by evidence. The law implies general damage in every infringement of an absolute right. The catch is that only nominal damages are awarded’  In addition to the special damages the court will award general damages to the tune of Ghc40.000.00 in favour of the plaintiff.  In conclusion the reliefs that the plaintiff seeks succeeds in respect of the following:  1\. An award of an amount of USD&113,233.80 or its cedi equivalent of Ghc293,726.93 as special damages.  2\. General damages of Ghc 40.000.00  In respect of cost, I will mulct the defendant in cost of Ghc 40.000.00 for defending a doomed case when it had been offered ample opportunity at the pre-trial stage to have settled this matter and when the evidence was so clear that a binding contract had come into being.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}"
"JUDGMENT  Plaintiff claims the following reliefs endorsed on its writ issued against the Defendant:  a) Recovery of the sum of €74,793 being the value of a BMW 7 series vehicle damaged in the custody of the Defendant  b) Interest on the said amount from 6th of November, 2014 to date of final payment General damages for negligence  c) Damages for loss of use of the vehicle from 6th of November, 2014 until date of receipt of full value for the vehicle.  d) Cost including lawyers’ fees (with liberty to apply)  In the statement of claim, Plaintiff states that it has been a long standing customer of Defendant, who is the sole agent and representative of BMW AG and Ford Motors in Ghana. Plaintiff avers that it purchased a BMW 7 series saloon vehicle with registration No GR 437-10 for the use of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), George Wiredu. Plaintiff notes that the said vehicle for some inexplicable reason suffered a battery fire which caused the Plaintiff to tow the vehicle to the workshop of the Defendant. Plaintiff claim to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor for the exact cause of the battery fire as it subsequently came to its attention that Defendant had recalled several vehicles worldwide to rectify problems responsible for battery fires. To Plaintiff Defendant took several months before it notified Plaintiff that it had repaired its vehicle whereupon the Plaintiff notified the Defendant that it was no longer interested in taking back the vehicle due to the security concerns it had about the vehicle when the fire incident happened.  To Plaintiff whiles discussions was ongoing regarding the vehicle, Defendant’s shop was flooded seriously affecting the vehicle but Defendant has failed to disclose to Plaintiff the full extent of the damage caused to the vehicle and contend that Defendant had been negligent. To Plaintiff overtures made towards an amicable settlement was met with lukewarm reception by the Defendant compelling the chair of Plaintiff’s CEO, Mr. Wiredu to fall on the vehicle of his wife resulting in inconveniences to his family and occasioning great loss and damage to him. Plaintiff states the particulars of the specific damage as loss of the BMW 7 series valued by Assenta Properties to be €60,000.00 and also loss of use of that vehicle. Plaintiff concludes that this has caused him severe anxiety and distress and hence the reliefs it seeks before the court. Defendant has denied the essential averments made by the Plaintiff. Defendant claim that the cause of the fire per its investigations was a smoke from a faulty electronic connector to the battery positive terminal unit and contend that with the exact cause of the fire known the Plaintiff cannot claim to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor.  Defendant claim that the vehicles recalled worldwide did not include the vehicle of Plaintiff. And any delays occasioned in the repair of Plaintiff’s vehicle was due to the frequent interference during the period of the repairs by Plaintiff. It is the further claim of Defendant that as Plaintiff failed to collect the vehicle after repairs it was mildly affected by the floods of June 3rd, 2015 and the flood was as a result of unprecedented rains which incident on that day was purely an Act of God as its occurrence could not have been anticipated by any human foresight or prudence. And that its premises had always been a secured place for its vehicles except the first time it experienced that nature of the flood. Defendant notes that any attempted settlement was totally without prejudice and the failure to reach a settlement was due entirely to plaintiff’s unreasonable demands. But was still opened to settlement of the suit.  With the closure of pleadings and the parties referred for pretrial conference and same unable to amicably resolve the dispute the following issues were set down for determination:  Whether or not the vehicle was damaged as a result of the Defendant’s negligence.  Whether or not the Plaintiff’s vehicle was part of the vehicles that were recalled by the manufacturer.  Whether or not the undue delay in the rectification of the Plaintiff’s Chief Executive officer’s vehicle was caused by the Defendant.  Whether or not the defect found on the vehicle was a manufacturer’s defect/product liability.  Whether or not the vehicle was roadworthy after being damaged by the June 3rd flooding.  Whether or not the Plaintiff can rely on the doctrine of res ipsa.  Whether or not the Plaintiff is entitled to the claim.  THE EVIDENCE  Plaintiff testified through its authorized representative, George Kofi Wiredu and tendered among others the following documents in support of the claim of Plaintiff:  i. A transfer of the vehicle BMW 7 series into the name of George Wiredu as Exhibit ‘A’.  ii. Series of letters exchanged between the lawyers for Plaintiff and the Defendant after the vehicle was towed to the garage of the Defendant and the presumed delay in the undertaking of the repair works in the workshop of Defendant as Exhibit ‘B’ series.  iii. Documents from Plaintiff to show the recall of some vehicles by the principal of Defendant as Exhibit ‘C’.  iv. Letters exchanged between the parties as Exhibit ‘D’ series.  v. Extracts from internet websites and newspapers coverage of the June, 2015 flooding in Accra as Exhibit ‘E’ series.  vi. A valuation report of the salvaged vehicle after the June, 2015 flood by Intercity STC Coaches Ltd as Exhibit ‘F’.  vii. Another valuation report on the same vehicle done by Assenta Property Consulting commissioned by Plaintiff as Exhibit ‘G’  viii. Invoices and rates of rental of vehicles from three companies as Ex ‘H’ series.  ix. A letter from Ghana Revenue Authority as Exhibit ‘J’.  The Defendant testified through its representative, Eugene Sangmortey and its first defence witness,  Joe Hyde Jnr. The following documents were also tendered on behalf of the Defendant:  A letter from Defendant to Plaintiff’s solicitors informing them of the cause of the fire at the battery terminal as Exhibit ‘1’  Report by Defendant on the vehicle as Exhibit ‘2’  A job card from Defendant as Exhibit ‘3’  Public notices put up by Defendant after the flood in Accra that it will not be accepting vehicles at its service center as Exhibit ‘4’ series’  Whilst Exhibits ‘5’ and ‘6’ consist of the valuation report from STC and technical data on the vehicle.  EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE  I begin the evaluation with the first issue raised in the issues set down for determination which is, whether or not the vehicle was damaged as a result of the Defendant’s negligence. I combine this with the fourth issue regarding whether or not the defect found on the vehicle was a manufacturer’s defect. It must be clarified that looking at the pleadings and the evidence during trial I glean two disparate allegations of negligence levelled by plaintiff which he is under a duty to prove them. The first leg of negligence I see is the claim by Plaintiff that Defendant failed in ensuring that the vehicle purchased did not have any latent or manufacturers defect and the second allegation of negligence is in relation to the flooding Accra in June 2015 that affected the vehicle of Plaintiff.  The first leg of claim of negligence situate it more within the sale of goods and whether the vehicle sold to Plaintiff’s Chief Executive Officer was fit for purpose and free from defects which were not declared and known to the buyer. By Ex ‘D1’ which is the warranty covering the vehicle provided, Defendant undertook to repair or replace parts of the vehicle found to be defective in materials or workmanship for a period of 24 months with unlimited mileage warranty. It must be noted that beside the warranty provided, as far as contracts are concerned, there are terms that even if not expressed, they are implied by common law or statute law. In Ghana, there are implied terms in respect of the sale of goods for both the seller and the buyer; and this contract was a contract for the sale of goods within section 1 of the Sale of Goods Act, Act 137.  Specifically section 13 on implied condition of fitness and quality of the goods sold, which both counsel referred to, states as follows:  “Quality and Fitness of Goods.  Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other enactment there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale except as follows—  (a). There is an implied condition that the goods are free from defects which are not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made: Provided that there is no such implied condition—  (i) where the buyer has examined the goods, in respect of defects which should have been revealed by the examination;  (ii) in the case of a sale by sample, in respect of defects which could have been discovered by a reasonable examination of the sample;  (iii) where the goods are not sold by the seller in the ordinary course of his business, in respect of defects of which the seller was not, and could not reasonably have been aware.  (b). Where the goods are of a description which are supplied by the seller in the course of his business and the buyer expressly or by implication makes known the purpose for which the goods are required there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose”.  What the provision means is that Ghana’s Sale of Goods Act, has moved away from the common law position of caveat emptor where the buyer must beware to one of caveat glovoson, where the seller must beware of the goods he is selling. The Act places onerous responsibility on the shoulders of sellers of both brand new and second goods as being liable for defects in them. The exceptions are, one, where the seller has declared the defects in the goods and nonetheless the buyer proceed to go ahead with the transaction, second where the buyer has examined the goods to satisfy himself and has been aware of defects that are manifest on the face of the goods.  The cause of the fault that led the vehicle to the workshop of Defendant has been provided by the Plaintiff as an inexplicable battery fire. And that when this happened on the 6th of November, 2014, more than four years after the purchase of the vehicle, the vehicle’s mileage was a little over 10,000km and for that reason, relies on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Defendant on the other hand gives the cause of the fault upon examination by its technicians as a ‘faulty electronic connector to the battery positive terminal unit’ which it communicated to the Plaintiff through its lawyers on the 14th of April, 2015.  The principle of res ipsa that Plaintiff seeks to rely on simply mean that ‘the thing speaks for itself’. This principle when relied on allows a Plaintiff to succeed in an action for negligence even though such a Plaintiff may be unable to produce concrete evidence as to what caused the accident. By relying on this principle Plaintiff seems to be saying that the accident should not have occurred had it not been due to a manufacturing defect. But can the faulty electronic connector to the battery terminal unit be deemed to be a latent defect or manufacturer’s defect as that was the diagnosis identified by the Defendant, almost five years after the purchase of the vehicle?  A look at Ex ‘D’ series which is the warranty provided the Plaintiff it covered a period of two years or twenty four months after the purchase of the vehicle. For in terms of the number of years, it must be noted that the vehicle had been with the Plaintiff’s representative for well over four years after purchase which is beyond the 24 months warranty provided by the Defendant in Ex ‘D’. However, the Plaintiff contend that the mileage of the vehicle was a little over 10,000km as the vehicle was used occasionally. Does it matter in computing how fairly new a vehicle is if it has been in the hands of the owner for a considerable number of years even though it is sparingly used? Defendant concede that the vehicle had done just over 10,000 km and yet having been in the hands of Plaintiff’s director for almost five years, it should not be seen only in terms of mileage as brand new.  This is what transpired when Counsel for Plaintiff cross-examined Defendant’s representative, Eugene Sangmortey:  “Q: You will agree with me that the battery connector is not a part that typically requires replacement over the life of the vehicle  A. My Lord, I disagree with him because as much as any component on the vehicle can fail, this particular unit could also fail anytime  Q. At the time you took possession of Mr. Wiredu’s vehicle, the vehicle has done just about 10,000km  A. My Lord, it has done a little over  Q. You will agree with me that typically in a year, a car will do 20,000 in normal use  A. My Lord I agree  Q. You will also agree with me that in technical terms the vehicle was virtually brand new  A. My Lord, I disagree because at the time it was a five year old vehicle irrespective of the mileage”.  The claim that the vehicle had done just a little over 10,000km and was therefore fairly brand new and still within the period covered under the warranty or any fault or defect discovered should be seen as a manufacturer’s or latent defect cannot be correct, I so hold and find. I agree with the Defendant and find as a fact, that the vehicle at the time it caught fire could not be deemed to be virtually brand new vehicle because it had low mileage. The age that it had spent in the hands of Plaintiff is also a factor. And under that circumstances, Plaintiff’s director was not right to have rejected the vehicle and demanded for a replacement after the repairs undertaken by Defendant free of charge to restore the vehicle to normalcy.  A party is entitled to a claim if a latent defect was to be discovered within a reasonable time after  purchase. What is latent defect has been defined in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary (5th ed, Vol 2, page 663) as:  “A latent defect is not simply any defect not discoverable through ordinary use and maintenance, but a defect or a flaw, generally in the metal or material itself, which could not be discovered by known and customary test.”  No wonder that on average, a two year warranty is provided the buyer, by which time it is conceivable that any hidden defect would have been discovered, but such a warranty was not meant to subsist ad infinitum during the entire lifetime of the use of the vehicle. The warranty will not cover a vehicle used for almost five years despite its low mileage as what may cause a defect may not just be the constant use of the vehicle but even how it is handled or kept which may not be shown by the mileage on the vehicle. I intend to deal with the other limp of the allegation of negligence regarding the flooding as the last issue.  ALLEGATION THAT THE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED  As part of the claim of Plaintiff that the vehicle had a latent defect it alleged that the principal company of Defendant in Germany BMW AG recalled BMW vehicles worldwide to repair battery connectors as they were susceptible to fires and that Defendant in Ghana failed to recall his vehicle for the necessary action. Plaintiff provides Exhibit ‘C’ series in support of his claim. Exhibit ‘C’ series are internet write-ups of recalls made by BMW. Defendant has denied that the particular brand of vehicle of the Plaintiff should have been recalled. Indeed Ex ‘1’ which is a letter to the lawyers for the Plaintiff, the Defendant intimated the recalls did not affect the vehicle of Plaintiff. The basis of the claim of Plaintiff is Ex ‘C’ which are internet sites that claim there were recalls. Those reports are not the official website reports from the Defendant or its principal in Germany neither are those reports the official reports put out by the Defendant. This was forcefully made when George Wiredu was under cross examination on the 10th of October, 2017 in the following:  “Q: Mr. Wiredu, one of your grievances in this case is that even though there was a worldwide recall of BMW vehicles, Mechanical Lloyd failed to notify you of that  A. Yes My Lord. The recall was with vehicles with the same problem, especially battery, because the battery controls all the gadgets in a car.  Q. I am suggesting to you that there is absolutely no basis for the position that you have taken, the recall position.  A; I disagree  Q. Exhibit ‘C’ which you have based your position on is entitled ‘BMW 7 series recall Information, not so?  A: Yes My Lord  Q. Exhibit ‘C’ does not emanate from the manufacturers of BMW themselves, is that not so?  A. From the information here, it is.  Q. I am suggesting to you that, that is not correct  A. My Lord I disagree because the thing states categorically all the types of model that were recalled.  Q. BMW, the manufacturers of the vehicle are not the authors of this document that you have exhibited.  A. Yes My Lord  Q. Do you know the authors of this document  A. I don’t know My Lord, this can be found on the internet.  Q. So you cannot vouch for its authenticity  A. No My Lord. Nowadays with technology this information could be verified ...”  I think the Defendant raised a genuine question regarding the authenticity of Exhibit ‘C’ series, being information gathered from the internet. The information was not gathered from the official web page of the principal of the Defendant and if indeed vehicles had been recalled worldwide, there would have been no difficulty at all on the part of Plaintiff to have had access to this information from the official website of Defendant or its principal in Germany. There seems to be a substantial question regarding the authenticity of Exhibit ‘C’ series. Exhibit ‘C’ contravenes the best evidence rule enunciated by Lord Hendricks in ONYCHUND v BARKER \[1745\] 1 AIK 21. The reasons why Plaintiff could not have had documents from official sources from Defendant or its principal was not even explained to the court and in this day and age when the internet can equally be a source of information and misinformation in equal measure, how genuine Exhibit ‘C’ may be was a legitimate issue for Defendant to have raised.  A court is always imbued with the power and discretion to exclude a document that has wrongly been admitted into evidence if at the time of writing the judgment it is the opinion of the court that a particular document should not have been admitted into evidence. And authenticity is a precondition precedent to admissibility of a writing. Section 136 of the Evidence Act, NRCD 323. See also the case of JUXON-SMITH v KLM DUTCH AIRLINES \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 438; where the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal to exclude four vital documents admitted by the trial Judge as the precondition necessary for their admissibility had been violated, thus sinning against section 136 of NRCD 323. Rather than rule that Ex ‘C’ was wrongly admitted and exclude same, I restrain myself from taking that path. Instead, I would place scant probative value or weight on Ex ‘C’ series due to the questions regarding its authenticity that I have raised supra. Accordingly I find as a fact that the claim of recalls of particular BMW vehicles that include the model bought by Plaintiff as alleged by Plaintiff was not satisfactorily proved by the Plaintiff who bears the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence on this issue.  DELAY IN THE REPAIR OF PLAINTIFF’S VEHICLE  Plaintiff claim that when the vehicle was towed to the garage of Defendant on the 6th of November, 2014 the vehicle was kept by Defendant for several months and he was kept in the dark as to the cause of the fire. From the evidence it appears Plaintiff intimated to the Defendant that he did not want the vehicle anymore. It is worthy of note that the rejection by Plaintiff’s director of the vehicle had nothing to do with any delay in fixing the problem with the vehicle. Ex ‘B’ being a letter written by Plaintiff’s lawyers gave the reason for the rejection in paragraph 1 of the letter as:  ‘Our client instructs us further that he notified you that he did not want the vehicle anymore by reason of the fact that had he rolled up the windows of the vehicle at the time of the fire he would in all certainty have been trapped in the vehicle potentially leading to serious injury or death’.  At the time Ex ‘B’ was written on the 2nd of March, 2015, the vehicle had been in the custody of Defendant for about three months. Ex ‘B2’ being the response of Defendant it assured Plaintiff that the repairs had been completed free of charge and invited Plaintiff’s director for a test drive. As Plaintiff’s director had made up his mind after the incident of the battery fire not to take the vehicle back, I think the four months or so that the vehicle spent in the custody of Defendant before the vehicle could be fixed then may not material as Plaintiff’s CEO had made up his mind not to take the vehicle back. This then leads the court to the resolution of the claim for damages for loss use of the vehicle that Plaintiff is claim. Plaintiff per relief d claim damages for loss of use of the vehicle from November 6 till date of receipt of the full value of the vehicle. The Plaintiff’s representative in his evidence in chief at paragraphs 32 and 33 provides further particulars of the claim for damages for the loss of use of the vehicle. Plaintiff claim that the daily rental value of such a vehicle is $300.00 a day and the Plaintiff’s CEO had to suffer the indignity of borrowing vehicles from his children and other officers to conduct his business. I reckon that the claim for recovery of loss of use of the vehicle is in the nature of special damages. Special damages are not presumed by law but must be pleaded, particularized and proved in court. The court would be unable to presume that Plaintiff’s CEO spent an amount of $300.00 each day for the use of alternative vehicle unless Plaintiff provides evidence to this claim. Did the Plaintiff prove expenses incurred for the use of alternative transport whiles the vehicle was in the custody of Defendant for repairs?  Plaintiff in the exhibits tendered before the court brought Exhibit ‘H’ series. Exhibit ‘H’ show an invoice or bill of $500.00 for BMW and Benz S class all totaling $1,000.00. Exhibit ‘H1’ is only a quotation of prices for rentals from a company called Yoks Rent A Car and does not demonstrate any expenses incurred for the use of alternative vehicles. Exhibit ‘H2’ does not show on the face of it who it is addressed to being a bill for the use of a vehicle for an amount of $411.35 whiles Exhibit ‘H3’ is addressed to Obeng Sakyi & Co being a proforma invoice.  Under cross examination George Wiredu rather showed that he did not pay for alternative vehicles costing $300.00 a day to be entitled to any such recovery in the following discourse:  “Q: Mr. Wiredu, at the last time you testified I was asking questions about your BMW vehicle... According to you that vehicle was purchased exclusively for your use as a CEO of Wiren International, not so?  A: Yes My Lord.  Q. Were you using it daily  A. No My Lord  Q. Apart from the vehicle you have a pool of vehicles at your disposal  A. No not at my disposal  Q. Are you saying that was the only vehicle at your disposal  A. I have an X6 which I was using from then  Q. Was that what you were using normally  A. The 7 series was for exceptional cases like going for an important meeting”.  The admission by Plaintiff’s representative that the vehicle was for exceptional or occasional use would not make Plaintiff entitled to an order for payment for daily rental use. Besides, Plaintiff even failed to lead any evidence to show the monies spent for the use of alternative vehicles as he concedes that there was an X6 vehicle which was used as an alternative vehicle and did not need to have resorted to the use of rental vehicles. See the cross examination of the Plaintiff’s CEO on the 23rd of October, 201. What is more, with the occurrence of the battery fire well outside the period of the warranty negating any finding of latent defect for which Defendant could have been responsible, the claim of special damages by Plaintiff for the use of alternative vehicles become a non sequitor, and I hereby find that Plaintiff is not entitled to such an award as Plaintiff could not prove any such damages and even if such damages had been proved, Plaintiff would have still failed in such a claim due to the expiration of the warranty.  WAS THE FLOOD THAT DAMAGED THE VEHICLE DUE TO NEGLIGENCE OR AN ACT OF GOD  Plaintiff has accused the Defendant for negligence for the damage caused to its vehicle due to the flood waters of June 3, 2015 and seeks a recovery of an amount of €74,000.00 as the value of the vehicle at the time it was damaged by the flood. As I have found the Defendant not liable in respect of negligence for the battery fire caused the vehicle of Plaintiff, can it also be that Defendant again is not liable for negligence for the damage caused Plaintiff’s vehicle due to the flood waters that engulfed Accra on the 3rd of June, 2015. Plaintiff in his evidence produced Exhibits ‘E’ series to show that it was not the first time that the South Industrial area, where Defendant is located had been flooded. There is evidence of flooding on July 4, 1995 and May 30, 2013.  For Plaintiff to be entitled to his claim for negligence he must prove that, one that Defendant owed a duty, two there has been a breach of that duty, three, that there is causation and four that harm has been occasioned Plaintiff as a result of the breach of the duty. Duty of care is the primary requirement for a successful claim in negligence. For if there is no duty the failure to take reasonable care would not give rise to liability. The leading judicial test for a duty of care in England was found in the judgments of CAPARO INDUSTRIES PLC v DICKMAN \[1990\] AC 605; in which the House of Lords set out the following three-part test: Harm must be a ""reasonably foreseeable"" result of the Defendant's conduct; A relationship of ""proximity"" must exist between the Defendant and the Plaintiff; It must be ""fair, just and reasonable"" to impose liability. See also the following cases DONOGUE v STEVENSON \[1932\] AC 562; CHAPMAN v HEARSE \[1961\] 106 CLR 112.  The second element in negligence is breach. Once it is established that there was a duty, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that defendant breached that duty and that involves testing of the actions of the defendant against the standards set out supra. A defendant who fails to realize the substantial risk of loss to a Plaintiff, which any reasonable person in the same situation would clearly have realized, is deemed to have breached that duty of care. The third element is causation. The loss that has occurred to the plaintiff must be directly attributable to the conduct of Defendant. The test is to find out whether the harm caused the Plaintiff was the proximate cause of Defendant’s conduct. The test usually is to ask if the injury would have occurred without the Defendant’s breach of the duty owed to the plaintiff. See STRONG v WOOLWORTHS \[2012\] 285 ALR 420.  Though the Plaintiff had rejected the vehicle and was demanding its replacement after the vehicle had been fixed and Plaintiff had been informed that the repairs were completed in April, 2015. And it was not until June 3, 2015 two months after that the flood waters caused damage to the vehicle. Notwithstanding the failure of Plaintiff to take the vehicle back, can it be said that Defendant was still under a duty to ensure that the vehicle was safe. And safe from what? Safe from theft, safe from fire, safe from the deliberate and calculated acts of Defendant’s staff or third parties. Can it be said that it was within the power of Defendant to have prevented or averted the flood that swept some parts of Accra on that June 3rd 2015 with its attendant havoc that it wrecked to property and human life?  The answer of Defendant to a charge of negligence in respect of the flood is the defence of an act of God. Was the flood an act of God and even if this defence fails I raise for my consideration as to whether a party can claim damages for the value of a property in the custody of a Defendant when he had clearly indicated that he did not want his property back any longer? And having so rejected the vehicle was the vehicle at the shop of Defendant at Plaintiff’s own suo periculo? Act of God is an unforeseen natural occurrence which when raised by a Defendant in an action in contract or tort and sustained discharged a party from the performance of his obligation. In the case of TENNANT v EARL OF GLASGOW (1864 2 M (HL) 22) an act of God was defined as:  “Circumstances which no human foresight can provide against, and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, and which when they do occur, therefore, are calamities that do not involve the obligation of paying for the consequences that may result from them”.  Lord Hobhouse in the case of TRANSCO PLC v STOCKPORT METROPOLITAN (2003) UKHL 61 where Transco plc had sued the council for repairs of £93,681.55 underneath one of its pipes in Brinnington. The ground beneath the gas pipe had washed away when the Council’s water pipe leaked. The court held the Council not to be liable and described an act of God to be an event that one involves no human agency, two which is due directly and exclusively attributable to natural causes, three and which could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight, plan or care. Foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still give rise to liability. Natural events such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis have all in the past been ruled to be acts of God.  Can the floods of June 3rd, 2015 be said to be act of God? That first depends on whether the Defendant could on its own have done something to prevent the flood waters from entering its workshop. From the evidence it was not only the Defendant’s workshop that was flooded but other shops such as PHC Motors, Toyota etc. Many parts of Accra were flooded and there could have been human factors involved that exacerbated the havoc caused by the rains. I cannot however find that something special or extraordinary was expected of the Defendant to have insulated it from the flood. I will therefore find as a fact that the flooding of Defendant’s premises where the vehicle of Plaintiff was kept thereby causing damage to the vehicle was an act of God.  Even if this finding is wrong it does not matter. Why? Defendant has repaired the vehicle free of charge way after the warranty had expired and had notified the Plaintiff to come for the vehicle but had refused more than three months before the flood. In that circumstance, Defendant bore no obligation to the Plaintiff as the vehicle was kept with the Defendant at Plaintiff’s own risk. I am not unmindful that attempts were made to amicably settle the matter, whereupon the parties commissioned Intercity STC to value the vehicle which was done as shown in Exhibit ‘F’. Plaintiff was however not happy with the value and commissioned his own independent valuation in Exhibit ‘G’ where Assenta  Properties put the open market value at €60,000.00 and forced sale value at €48,000.00. This second valuation at the instance of Plaintiff could be said to be self-serving. The attempt at settlement before court and even in the course of trial was totally without prejudice and could not be said to bind the Defendant. For good business practice and to retain an abiding client, a business entity may decide to give more than what the law requires and that cannot be used as evidence of liability.  On the whole, I find the claims of Plaintiff unproved and not meriting an award of the court for the reliefs claimed. I accordingly dismiss the claim of Plaintiff in its entirety. Each party shall its own cost.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'CM/0103/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF – SAMANTHA CARBOO FOR RANDALL OBENG-SAYKI  \r', 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT – ALFRED ENYAAH FOR PETER ZWENNES'], 'combinedParties': ['WIREN INTERNATIONAL GH LTD - (PLAINTIFF)', 'MECHANICAL LLYOD CO.
