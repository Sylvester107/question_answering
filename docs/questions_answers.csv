"Contract has been defined as ‘a promise or set of promises which the law will enforce’. See Frederick Pollock’s Principles of Contract: A Treatise on the General Principles Concerning the Validity of Agreements in the Law of England, 7th ed. A contract therefore comes into being when there had been an exchange of promises between two or more parties or when a promise had been given in exchange for the performance of an act. What needs to be present for any agreement to be enforceable is one whether there had been a promise by one party. This usually may be reflected in the nature of an offer. And if there is an offer whether the offer has unconditionally been accepted. And if it has been accepted whether from the nature of the whole transaction there was an intention to create legal relations.  Indeed in the case of NTHC v YAA ANTWI \[2009\] SCGLR 117 this is how the learned Justice Date-Bah defined a valid offer and acceptance in a case where Ms Antwi had communicated her acceptance of an offer to sell a house she was living in to her and had not even paid the money long after the communication:  “Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}",0.5782131561140023,What case defines what an offer is?,"In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms:  “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.”  The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer. The disagreement in that case between the Court of Appeal and the trial judge was as to whether there had been any acceptance of this offer. The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter.

Appellant unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”. He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that', 'appellant committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the appellant in 2002', 'Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that', '1. “The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because', 'a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The Appellant, reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings', 'b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person', 'c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the Appellant – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction', 'd. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest', 'Given the appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the appellant did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect', 'Following the dismissal of his appeal, the appellant first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although', 'it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable', 'In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the appellant be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of', 'At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the appellant’s, could not be traced.

This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing', 'Generally, the responsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an appellant’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an appellant conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an appellant’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the appellant’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice appellant stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders', '1. “…The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date', '2. Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders', 'The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads', '1. “That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court', '2. That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof', '3. Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015', 'Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case', 'In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an appellant entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the appellant, are irretrievably lost or destroyed', 'Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents', 'Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised', 'The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend Respondent Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised', 'It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development', 'We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning', 'The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 - Evidence; Documentary 1734 – Court record lost or destroyed” provides', 'a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged', 'b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record', '28 U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that', 'a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court', 'b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court', 'States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations', 'Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides', 'Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An appellant is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances', '1) If the appellant has timely requested a reporter’s record', '2) If, without the appellant’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible', '3) If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and', '4) If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit', 'The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR, decided August 2, 2005, on the basis of the relevant legislation, set out the relevant factors that must inform the court’s decisions. Understandably, it emphasises the necessity for the court to ensure that a reconstructed record adequately reflects what actually occurred at the hearing', 'Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part', 'Pending Criminal Actions', 'Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the defendant or the defendant himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases', 'Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried', 'Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided', 'The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities', 'Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A401/2011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that', 'An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the appellant have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (105/2007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant. But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the appellant in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the appellant was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied.

The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Wood, CJ', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2015\\122.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'JOHN BONUAH @ ERIC ANNOR BLAY vs THE REPUBLIC & WOOD (MRS) CJ & On the 28th of February, 2002, the  and one Billy who is at large, were tried and convicted by the Sunyani High Court of the offences of conspiracy to commit robbery to ss. 23 and 149, and robbery contrary to s. 149 of Act 2960 and sentenced to life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.  unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”.

In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised & It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development & We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning & The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 & a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged & b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record & U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that & a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court & b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court & States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations & Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides & Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An  is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances & If the  has timely requested a reporter’s record & If, without the ’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible & If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and & If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit & The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part & Pending Criminal Actions & Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the  or the  himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases & Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried & Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided & The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities & Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A4012011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that & An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record & Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus & Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E & The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus & the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b & The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows & a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record & b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record & c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues & In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms & In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered & Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that & the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law & The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial & The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact & Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors & First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes & The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings & The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision & Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials & Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings & An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question & Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc & In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records & In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following & Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced & Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility', 'short': 'Bonuah vs Republic'}}",0.13018788646490065
" I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.

"""The Court or a Judge may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any indorsement or pleading which may be unnecessary...""  It seems to me that what ought to be pleaded in these res ipsa loquitur cases is not the mere words ""res ipsa loquitur""; incantatory words as Amissah J.A. called them in Nelson v. Klutse (supra.); these words by themselves do not in any way advance the narrative of the plaintiff's case. Facts should rather be pleaded which taken together prove that the damage suffered by the plaintiff could not have happened but for the presumptive \[p.328\] negligence of the defendant. In fact in these res ipsa loquitur cases what actually contributed to the damage is unknown to the plaintiff since he was not in control of the res. The person in control of the res is the defendant and because being in control, the damage or injury ought not to have happened if he exercised care and diligence, an onus is cast on him to show that the damage was not caused by his negligence or the negligence of his servant.  This is the legal and commonsense approach to the problem which commends itself to me and which finds support in the views of Davies L.J. in the English case of Bennett v. Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd. \[1971\] 3 All E.R. 822 at p. 825, C.A.

It has been fashionable in some personal injury claims founded on negligence to plead res ipsa loquitur. Indeed in Bullen and Leake's Precedents of pleadings (11th ed.) at p. 536, there is a suggestion that it is proper to plead res ipsa loquitur in certain cases and in fact in Nelson v. Klutse, Court of Appeal, 8 September 1969, unreported; digested in (1969) C.C. 142, this point regarding pleading res ipsa loquitur and the treatment of \[p.327\] that plea in Bullen and Leake was urged on the Court of Appeal in an argument calculated to show that failure to allege res ipsa loquitur in a statement of claim disbars the plaintiff from relying on the doctrine.

Plaintiff avers that it purchased a BMW 7 series saloon vehicle with registration No GR 437-10 for the use of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), George Wiredu. Plaintiff notes that the said vehicle for some inexplicable reason suffered a battery fire which caused the Plaintiff to tow the vehicle to the workshop of the Defendant. Plaintiff claim to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor for the exact cause of the battery fire as it subsequently came to its attention that Defendant had recalled several vehicles worldwide to rectify problems responsible for battery fires. To Plaintiff Defendant took several months before it notified Plaintiff that it had repaired its vehicle whereupon the Plaintiff notified the Defendant that it was no longer interested in taking back the vehicle due to the security concerns it had about the vehicle when the fire incident happened.  To Plaintiff whiles discussions was ongoing regarding the vehicle, Defendant’s shop was flooded seriously affecting the vehicle but Defendant has failed to disclose to Plaintiff the full extent of the damage caused to the vehicle and contend that Defendant had been negligent. To Plaintiff overtures made towards an amicable settlement was met with lukewarm reception by the Defendant compelling the chair of Plaintiff’s CEO, Mr. Wiredu to fall on the vehicle of his wife resulting in inconveniences to his family and occasioning great loss and damage to him. Plaintiff states the particulars of the specific damage as loss of the BMW 7 series valued by Assenta Properties to be €60,000.00 and also loss of use of that vehicle. Plaintiff concludes that this has caused him severe anxiety and distress and hence the reliefs it seeks before the court. Defendant has denied the essential averments made by the Plaintiff. Defendant claim that the cause of the fire per its investigations was a smoke from a faulty electronic connector to the battery positive terminal unit and contend that with the exact cause of the fire known the Plaintiff cannot claim to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'CM/0103/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF – SAMANTHA CARBOO FOR RANDALL OBENG-SAYKI  \r', 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT – ALFRED ENYAAH FOR PETER ZWENNES'], 'combinedParties': ['WIREN INTERNATIONAL GH LTD - (PLAINTIFF)', 'MECHANICAL LLYOD CO.

"It is noted that the appellants conceded in paragraph 4 (supra) of the supplementary affidavit that the Directors, shareholders, officers of the respondent company are distinct from the company in the instant appeal, the Directors among others thus are distinct from the respondent company which has legal personality.  However, the legal personality and its distinct from its members and or directors can be ignored by law and the veil of incorporation could be lifted or pierced to ascribe liability to various individuals or corporations in exceptional circumstances that the company was established to further fraudulent activities, defeat public convenience, justify wrong to avoid contractual liability or defend crime among others. This is known as the alter ego doctrine. Indeed, the learned trial judge stated the law correctly in her Ruling at pages 210 and 211 of the record of appeal thus:-  “I have looked at the plethora of cases that the counsel for the Directors of GHACEM rely on and also researched same and I must admit that it resonates so strongly within all these cases with clarity that a Limited Liability Company or Corporation has its legal existence apart from its Directors and members. It also echoes throughout those cases that seldom will the veil be lifted unless it can be proven in exceptional circumstances that the company has been established to further fraudulent activities to avoid contractual liability. (See the cases of MORKOR VRS KUMA (supra), OWUSU VRS R. N. THORNE (supra), SALOMON (supra), SOONBOON SEO (supra) etc.). It is not the law that, simply because judgment debts remain unpaid by a subsidiary company the mother company or directors must be held responsible …. In the present circumstances I am of the humble view that the applicants have not measured up to the mark by establishing any such wrong conduct on the part of Plaintiff Company nor its directors to enable the veil to be lifted”.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

The governing body of the State Gold Mining Corporation is a board which has power to delegate to the managing director of a mining company the power to appoint persons as employees of the corporation. This power to appoint is reserved for the owner of the mines. It is not denied that the state Gold Mining Corporation appoints the general manager, the chief engineer and the general mines Manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. as is required by the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665). The daily-rated employees and other junior staff of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. are appointed by the Prestea Goldfields but this does not detract from the fact that the Prestea Goldfields itself derives its authority to run the mines generally from the State Gold Mining Corporation. In order to control and effectively monitor the system of work at Prestea Goldfields Ltd. the State Gold Mining Corporation has introduced a method by which Prestea Goldfields Ltd. sends monthly returns for payment and \[p.208\] other activities to the State Gold Mining Corporation. In my view therefore the State Gold Mining Corporation effectively controls the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., who is the agent of the State Gold Mining Corporation.  The next question to consider is whether the State Gold Mining Corporation works the mines through their agent Prestea Goldfields Ltd. A company is said to be the subsidiary of another if that other (the holding company) is a member of it and controls the composition of its board of directors, or if the holding company holds more than half its ""equity share capital"": see the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), Sched. I, s. 2. Under the ordinary rules of law a parent company and a subsidiary company, even a hundred per cent subsidiary, are distinct legal entities. However it seems there is no rule of law which says that a company cannot and should not act as the agent of its holders. No problem arises where there is an express agreement as in Southern (Inspector of Taxes) v. Watson \[1940\] 3 All E.R. 439, C.A. where after the business had been converted into a private company the agreement provided that the company should fulfil existing contracts as agents of the seller. Where there is no such agreement it is a question of fact in each case whether the subsidiary company is carrying on the parent company's business or its own.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Dakwa-Dwenena (with him Brobbey) for the plaintiff', 'Kocuvie Tay for the defendants and co-defendants'], 'combinedParties': ['KUNI v.

There was a second charge of causing damage to the complainant's spectacles upon which he was also convicted. The prosecution's case which the court accepted, was that prior to the day of the incident, relations had become strained between the neighbours. There was a hedge which separated their two properties. It had a hole in it. The appellant sought to block it. The complainant and her husband, taking the view that the hedge was wholly within their property objected to the appellant's interference with it. Heated arguments between the \[p.613\] parties on either side of the hedge occurred over the rival claims. On the day of the incident, the complainant's husband had got someone to remove the barriers erected by the appellant blocking the openings in the hedge. But this man had been stopped by the appellant. When the complainant's husband returned from work he found this assignment uncompleted and he went to do it himself. The appellant saw him and tried to stop him. An argument ensued which was joined in by some members of the households of the men involved.  The appellant is a doctor practising at Tema Hospital. In the course of the argument, the complainant according to the prosecution said to the appellant that certain nurses had said that he had been misbehaving at the hospital. This apparently was too much for the appellant to bear because upon hearing it, he jumped over to the complainant's side of the hedge and gave her a slap which resulted in her spectacles falling off and breaking.

Appellant unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”. He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that', 'appellant committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the appellant in 2002', 'Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that', '1. “The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because', 'a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The Appellant, reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings', 'b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person', 'c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the Appellant – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction', 'd. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest', 'Given the appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the appellant did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect', 'Following the dismissal of his appeal, the appellant first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although', 'it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable', 'In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the appellant be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of', 'At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the appellant’s, could not be traced.

This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing', 'Generally, the responsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an appellant’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an appellant conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an appellant’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the appellant’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice appellant stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders', '1. “…The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date', '2. Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders', 'The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads', '1. “That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court', '2. That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof', '3. Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015', 'Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case', 'In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an appellant entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the appellant, are irretrievably lost or destroyed', 'Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents', 'Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised', 'The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend Respondent Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised', 'It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development', 'We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning', 'The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 - Evidence; Documentary 1734 – Court record lost or destroyed” provides', 'a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged', 'b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record', '28 U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that', 'a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court', 'b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court', 'States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations', 'Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides', 'Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An appellant is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances', '1) If the appellant has timely requested a reporter’s record', '2) If, without the appellant’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible', '3) If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and', '4) If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit', 'The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR, decided August 2, 2005, on the basis of the relevant legislation, set out the relevant factors that must inform the court’s decisions. Understandably, it emphasises the necessity for the court to ensure that a reconstructed record adequately reflects what actually occurred at the hearing', 'Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part', 'Pending Criminal Actions', 'Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the defendant or the defendant himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases', 'Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried', 'Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided', 'The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities', 'Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A401/2011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that', 'An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the appellant have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (105/2007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant.

The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse.

Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the , are irretrievably lost or destroyed & Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents & Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an ’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised & The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised & It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development & We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning & The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 & a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged & b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record & U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that & a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court & b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court & States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations & Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides & Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An  is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances & If the  has timely requested a reporter’s record & If, without the ’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible & If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and & If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit & The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v.

If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided & The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities & Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A4012011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that & An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record & Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus & Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E & The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus & the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b & The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows & a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record & b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record & c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues & In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms & In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered & Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that & the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law & The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial & The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact & Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors & First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes & The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings & The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision & Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials & Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings & An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question & Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc & In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records & In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following & Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced & Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility', 'short': 'Bonuah vs Republic'}}",0.5789444836278099,the effect of failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal,"Generally, the responsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court.

Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago.

Indeed, at the hearing, the  did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction.

The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although', 'it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable', 'In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the  be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of', 'At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the ’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing', 'Generally, the onsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an ’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an  conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an ’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the ’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice  stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders', 'The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date', 'Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders', 'The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads', 'That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court', 'That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof', 'Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015', 'Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case', 'In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an  entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the , are irretrievably lost or destroyed', 'Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents', 'Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an ’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised', 'The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised', 'It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development', 'We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning', 'The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115', 'a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged', 'b.

The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an ’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an  conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an ’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the ’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice  stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders & The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date & Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders & The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads & That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court & That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof & Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015 & Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case & In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an  entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the , are irretrievably lost or destroyed & Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents & Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an ’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised & The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised & It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development & We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning & The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 & a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged & b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record & U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that & a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court & b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court & States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations & Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides & Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An  is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances & If the  has timely requested a reporter’s record & If, without the ’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible & If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and & If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit & The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part & Pending Criminal Actions & Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the  or the  himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases & Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried & Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided & The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities & Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A4012011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that & An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record & Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus & Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E & The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus & the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b & The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows & a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record & b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record & c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues & In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms & In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered & Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that & the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law & The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial & The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact & Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors & First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes & The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings & The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision & Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials & Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule.

Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly.

This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant. But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the appellant in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the appellant was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied.

The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although', 'it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable', 'In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the  be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of', 'At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the ’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing', 'Generally, the onsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings.

Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago.

He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that & committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the  in 2002 & Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that & The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because & a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The , reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings & b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person & c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the  – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction & d. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest & Given the ’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the  did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect & Following the dismissal of his appeal, the  first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although & it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable & In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the  be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of & At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the ’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing & Generally, the onsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an ’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an  conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an ’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the ’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice  stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders & The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date & Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders & The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads & That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court & That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof & Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015 & Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case & In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an  entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the , are irretrievably lost or destroyed & Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents & Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an ’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised & The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend  Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised & It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development & We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning & The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 & a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged & b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record & U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that & a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court & b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court & States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations & Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides & Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An  is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances & If the  has timely requested a reporter’s record & If, without the ’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible & If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and & If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit & The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v.

In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings & An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question & Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc & In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records & In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following & Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced & Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility', 'short': 'Bonuah vs Republic'}}",0.28708087253263637

It said that this was a reasonable period in which Hemans might look for a new job.  With respect, it is a contradiction in terms to speak of compensation for lawful termination of employment. If the termination is lawful the worker may be called upon to work during the period of notice. Any payment made to him during the period is not compensation or damages, but wages or salary due to him under the contract of employment. If it were damages he could not be compelled to render any services as a condition for being paid. It is the readiness of the employee to work and the unwillingness of the employer to permit him to do so that makes the termination wrongful and entitles the worker to receive as damages what he would have earned if the contract of service had been observed.
